            <p>This module delves into the foundational principles that govern all effective visual communication. Understanding these core concepts is essential for creating designs that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also clear, organized, and impactful. We will explore the theories behind balance, contrast, hierarchy, and other key principles that form the bedrock of good design.</p>
            
            <h2>What You Will Learn:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balance, Contrast, and Hierarchy:</strong> Learn how to distribute visual weight, create emphasis, and guide the viewer's eye through a composition.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment, Proximity, and Repetition:</strong> Discover how to create visual connections, group related items, and build a cohesive and unified design.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Theory:</strong> Explore the psychology of color, learn about color harmonies, and understand the differences between RGB and CMYK color models.</li>
                <li><strong>Typography Theory:</strong> Dive into the art of arranging type, from understanding the anatomy of a letterform to pairing fonts and creating a clear typographic hierarchy.</li>
                <li><strong>Gestalt Principles:</strong> Uncover the psychological principles that explain how humans perceive and organize visual information, and learn how to apply them to create intuitive and effective designs.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By the end of this module, you will have a robust theoretical framework to inform your design decisions, enabling you to create more intentional, sophisticated, and successful visual communications.</p>
