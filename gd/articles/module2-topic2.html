        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Beyond balance, contrast, and hierarchy, three other fundamental principles—alignment, proximity, and repetition—are critical for creating organized, cohesive, and professional graphic designs. These principles help to establish visual relationships between elements and improve the overall readability and aesthetic appeal of a composition.</p>

            <h2>Alignment</h2>
            <p><strong>Alignment</strong> refers to the arrangement of elements along a common edge or line. It is the principle that dictates that nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every element should have a visual connection with something else on the page. Proper alignment creates a clean, crisp, and sophisticated look, making a design feel organized and unified. Misaligned elements, conversely, can make a design appear messy, unprofessional, and difficult to process.</p>
            <p>Common types of alignment include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Left Alignment:</strong> Text and elements are aligned along their left edge. This is the most common and generally easiest to read for left-to-right languages.</li>
                <li><strong>Right Alignment:</strong> Text and elements are aligned along their right edge. Can be used for visual interest or specific design needs, but can be harder to read in long blocks of text.</li>
                <li><strong>Center Alignment:</strong> Text and elements are centered horizontally. Often used for headlines, short blocks of text, or symmetrical layouts, but can appear less formal or harder to read in large blocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Justified Alignment:</strong> Text is aligned along both the left and right margins, creating clean edges. This is common in newspapers and books but can sometimes lead to awkward spacing between words (rivers).</li>
                <li><strong>Edge Alignment:</strong> Aligning elements to the edges of the page or a defined grid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consistent alignment throughout a design creates a strong, invisible structure that enhances readability and visual appeal.</p>

            <h2>Proximity</h2>
            <p><strong>Proximity</strong> is the principle that states that related items should be grouped together. When elements are placed close to each other, the human eye perceives them as belonging to a single unit or concept, rather than as separate, unrelated items. This helps to organize information, reduce clutter, and improve the overall understanding of the design.</p>
            <p>By using proximity effectively, designers can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduce Clutter:</strong> Grouping related items minimizes the number of individual elements the viewer's eye has to process.</li>
                <li><strong>Create Visual Relationships:</strong> It clearly communicates which pieces of information are connected. For example, a headline, a paragraph of text, and an image related to that text should be placed close together.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Readability:</strong> When information is logically grouped, it becomes easier for the viewer to scan and comprehend.</li>
                <li><strong>Establish Hierarchy:</strong> Larger spaces between unrelated groups and smaller spaces within related groups help to define visual hierarchy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Proximity is a powerful yet often subtle tool that significantly impacts how a design's message is received and understood.</p>

            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <p><strong>Repetition</strong> involves the consistent use of certain elements or styles throughout a design. This can include repeating colors, shapes, textures, typefaces, line weights, or spatial relationships. The purpose of repetition is to create unity, consistency, and a sense of rhythm within a composition, making it feel cohesive and professional.</p>
            <p>The benefits of repetition in design include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> It ensures that a design looks like a unified whole rather than a collection of disparate parts. This is particularly important in branding, where consistent visual elements build recognition and trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Unity:</strong> Repeating elements tie different parts of a design together, even if they are physically separated.</li>
                <li><strong>Rhythm and Flow:</strong> Repetition can create a visual rhythm that guides the viewer's eye through the design.</li>
                <li><strong>Brand Recognition:</strong> Consistent use of brand elements (logo, colors, fonts) across all materials reinforces brand identity and makes it memorable.</li>
                <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> When certain styles are consistently applied to certain types of information (e.g., all subheadings are bold and blue), it helps the viewer quickly understand the structure and content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Repetition is a subtle yet powerful principle that strengthens a design's overall impact and ensures a professional and polished appearance.</p>
