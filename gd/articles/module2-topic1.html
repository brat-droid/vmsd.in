        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Effective graphic design is built upon a foundation of fundamental principles that guide the arrangement and presentation of visual elements. Among the most crucial are balance, contrast, and hierarchy, which work in concert to create visually appealing, organized, and communicative designs.</p>
            
            <h2>Balance</h2>
            <p><strong>Balance</strong> in design refers to the distribution of visual weight within a composition. Just as physical objects have weight, visual elements possess a perceived weight that can attract or repel the eye. Achieving balance creates a sense of equilibrium, stability, and harmony, making a design feel complete and comfortable to view.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symmetrical Balance:</strong> This occurs when elements are arranged equally on either side of a central axis, creating a mirror image. Symmetrical balance often conveys formality, stability, and tradition. While it can be visually pleasing, too much symmetry can sometimes feel static or predictable.</li>
                <li><strong>Asymmetrical Balance:</strong> This is achieved when elements of differing visual weights are arranged to create equilibrium without being identical on both sides. For example, a large element on one side might be balanced by several smaller elements on the other. Asymmetrical balance often feels more dynamic, modern, and engaging, offering more creative freedom while still maintaining visual harmony.</li>
                <li><strong>Radial Balance:</strong> Elements are arranged around a central point, radiating outwards. This creates a strong focal point and a sense of movement or energy, often seen in logos or circular compositions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <p><strong>Contrast</strong> is the difference between two or more elements in a design. It is a powerful tool for creating visual interest, drawing attention to specific areas, and organizing information. Without contrast, designs can appear flat, monotonous, and difficult to read or understand.</p>
            <p>Contrast can be achieved through various means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> Using opposing colors (e.g., warm vs. cool, light vs. dark, complementary colors) to make elements stand out.</li>
                <li><strong>Size Contrast:</strong> Varying the scale of elements to emphasize importance or create visual tension (e.g., a large headline next to small body text).</li>
                <li><strong>Shape Contrast:</strong> Juxtaposing geometric shapes with organic ones, or sharp angles with soft curves.</li>
                <li><strong>Texture Contrast:</strong> Combining smooth and rough, or soft and hard textures to add tactile interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Typographic Contrast:</strong> Using different font families (serif vs. sans-serif), weights (bold vs. light), or styles (italic vs. regular) to differentiate text elements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Effective contrast guides the viewer's eye, highlights key information, and adds depth and dynamism to a composition.</p>

            <h2>Hierarchy</h2>
            <p><strong>Hierarchy</strong> (or visual hierarchy) is the arrangement of design elements in a way that indicates their order of importance. It guides the viewer's eye through the design, ensuring that the most critical information is seen first and that the content is consumed in a logical and intuitive sequence.</p>
            <p>Designers establish hierarchy using several techniques:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Larger elements typically appear more important than smaller ones.</li>
                <li><strong>Color:</strong> Bright, saturated, or contrasting colors can draw attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Elements placed at the top or center of a composition often receive more attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Varying font size, weight, style, and case (e.g., all caps) to differentiate headlines, subheadings, and body text.</li>
                <li><strong>White Space:</strong> Surrounding an important element with ample white space can make it stand out.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent use of a particular style for similar types of information reinforces their relationship and importance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A clear visual hierarchy is essential for effective communication, preventing information overload and ensuring that the design's message is conveyed efficiently and effectively.</p>
