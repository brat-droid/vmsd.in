            <p>In graphic design, understanding color models is fundamental, as the choice of model directly impacts how colors are displayed and reproduced across different mediums. The two most prevalent color models are <strong>CMYK</strong> and <strong>RGB</strong>, each serving distinct purposes for print and digital applications, respectively.</p>

            <h2>RGB (Red, Green, Blue): The Additive Color Model</h2>
            <p><strong>RGB</strong> is an additive color model, meaning that colors are created by adding different intensities of red, green, and blue light. When all three colors are combined at their full intensity, they produce white light. When all three are absent, the result is black.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How it Works:</strong> RGB is based on how human eyes perceive color and how light is emitted from screens. Pixels on a digital display (monitors, TVs, smartphones) contain tiny red, green, and blue light sources that combine to create the full spectrum of colors we see.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Use:</strong> Digital displays and web-based content. Any design intended for viewing on a screen should be created and saved in the RGB color mode.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Websites, mobile apps, digital advertisements, social media graphics, videos, and digital photography.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Gamut:</strong> RGB generally has a wider color gamut (can display more colors) than CMYK, meaning some vibrant colors seen on screen may not be accurately reproduced in print.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black): The Subtractive Color Model</h2>
            <p><strong>CMYK</strong> is a subtractive color model, meaning that colors are created by subtracting (absorbing) light from a white surface (like paper) using inks. The four colors—Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (Black)—are combined in varying percentages to produce a wide range of colors. When all four inks are combined at full intensity, they theoretically produce black, though in practice, a rich black is often achieved by combining all four colors.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How it Works:</strong> CMYK is based on how pigments absorb and reflect light. When light hits a printed surface, certain wavelengths are absorbed by the ink, and others are reflected back to our eyes.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Use:</strong> Professional printing. Any design intended for physical output (e.g., brochures, business cards, packaging, posters) should be converted to the CMYK color mode before sending to a commercial printer.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Business cards, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, product packaging, billboards.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Gamut:</strong> CMYK has a more limited color gamut compared to RGB. This is why colors can sometimes appear duller or different when printed compared to how they looked on screen.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why the Distinction Matters:</h2>
            <p>The critical issue for designers is the potential for color shift. If a design created in RGB is sent to a commercial printer without being converted to CMYK, the colors in the final printed product may not match what was seen on screen. Vibrant blues and greens in RGB, for instance, can appear muted or dull in CMYK print.</p>
            <p><strong>Best Practice:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always design in RGB if the final output is for screens (web, digital displays).</li>
                <li>Always convert your design to CMYK if the final output is for professional printing. Most design software (like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) allows you to work in either mode and convert between them. It's often recommended to design in RGB (as it has a wider gamut) and then convert to CMYK as the last step before sending to print, making any necessary color adjustments during the conversion process.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding the fundamental differences between CMYK and RGB is crucial for ensuring color accuracy and achieving predictable results across various design projects.</p>
