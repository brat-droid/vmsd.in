        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Adobe Photoshop is arguably the most iconic and widely used software in the graphic design industry. It's a powerful raster graphics editor that has become synonymous with image manipulation, photo retouching, and digital painting. From professional photographers and illustrators to web designers and marketers, Photoshop is an indispensable tool for creating, enhancing, and transforming pixel-based images. Its versatility and extensive feature set make it a cornerstone of any designer's digital toolkit.</p>

            <p>This module will introduce you to the core concepts of raster graphics and the fundamental functionalities of Adobe Photoshop. Understanding how Photoshop works and developing proficiency in its key tools will empower you to unleash your creative vision, whether you're perfecting a photograph, designing a web layout, or crafting a digital masterpiece.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Raster Graphics: The World of Pixels</h2>
            <p>Before diving into Photoshop, it's crucial to understand the nature of raster graphics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pixel-Based:</strong> Raster images are composed of a grid of individual colored squares called pixels.</li>
                <li><strong>Resolution Dependent:</strong> The quality of a raster image is tied to its resolution (pixels per inch/PPI or dots per inch/DPI). Scaling a raster image up too much will result in pixelation (blurriness or blockiness).</li>
                <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Photographs, complex digital paintings, and images with subtle color gradients and textures.</li>
                <li><strong>Common File Formats:</strong> JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Photoshop excels at manipulating these pixel-based images, allowing for intricate detail and realistic effects.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts and Interface Overview</h2>
            <p>Navigating Photoshop effectively requires understanding its core concepts and interface:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Layers:</strong> The most fundamental concept. Photoshop allows you to work on different elements of an image independently on separate layers, enabling non-destructive editing and complex compositions.</li>
                <li><strong>Selection Tools:</strong> Used to isolate specific areas of an image for editing (e.g., Marquee, Lasso, Magic Wand, Quick Selection, Pen Tool for precise paths).</li>
                <li><strong>Masks:</strong> Non-destructive way to hide or reveal parts of a layer without permanently erasing pixels. Crucial for compositing and photo manipulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjustment Layers:</strong> Non-destructive way to apply color and tonal adjustments (e.g., Brightness/Contrast, Curves, Hue/Saturation) to an image.</li>
                <li><strong>Blending Modes:</strong> Control how layers interact with each other, creating various visual effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Filters:</strong> Apply artistic effects, blurs, distortions, and sharpening to images.</li>
                <li><strong>Brushes:</strong> Used for painting, drawing, and applying effects with customizable shapes, sizes, and opacities.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Objects:</strong> Layers that contain raster or vector image data from Photoshop or Illustrator. They preserve an image's source content with all its original characteristics, allowing for non-destructive scaling, rotating, and warping.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="micro-animation-placeholder" style="height: 150px; background-color: #f0f0f0; border: 1px dashed #ccc; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-style: italic;">

            <h2>Basic Workflow in Photoshop</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Open/Create Document:</strong> Start with an existing image or create a new document with desired dimensions and resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Organize with Layers:</strong> Place different elements (background, subject, text, effects) on separate layers.</li>
                <li><strong>Make Selections:</strong> Use appropriate selection tools to isolate areas for editing.</li>
                <li><strong>Apply Adjustments:</strong> Use adjustment layers for color correction, exposure, and tonal changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Retouching/Painting:</strong> Use brushes, clone stamp, healing tools for photo retouching or digital painting.</li>
                <li><strong>Compositing:</strong> Combine multiple images using masks and blending modes.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Text/Shapes:</strong> Incorporate typographic elements and vector shapes.</li>
                <li><strong>Save and Export:</strong> Save your work as a PSD (Photoshop Document) for future editing, and export as JPEG, PNG, etc., for web or print.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Indian Case Studies: Photoshop's Impact in India</h2>
            <p>Photoshop is an indispensable tool across various creative industries in India, from Bollywood to e-commerce.</p>

            <h4>Case Study 1: Bollywood Movie Posters - Visual Storytelling and Compositing</h4>
            <p>Bollywood movie posters are often a vibrant showcase of Photoshop's capabilities.
