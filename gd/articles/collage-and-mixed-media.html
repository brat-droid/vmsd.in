        <div class="article-content">
            <p>In the expansive landscape of graphic design, where visual communication is key, some of the most compelling and thought-provoking works emerge from the fusion of disparate elements. This is the essence of collage and mixed media â€“ artistic techniques that involve assembling various forms, materials, and images to create a new whole. Far from being a mere cut-and-paste exercise, these approaches allow designers to layer meanings, juxtapose ideas, and construct rich visual narratives that can be both complex and deeply resonant.</p>

            <p>Collage, traditionally involving physical materials like paper, photographs, and fabric, has found a powerful new life in the digital realm, where designers can seamlessly combine images, textures, and typography with unparalleled flexibility. Mixed media extends this concept by incorporating a wider range of materials and techniques, blurring the lines between different art forms. Mastering these approaches empowers designers to create unique, expressive, and highly impactful visuals that stand out in a visually saturated world.</p>

            <h2>What is Collage? The Art of Juxtaposition</h2>
            <p>Collage (from the French "coller," to glue) is an artistic technique of assembling different forms, thus creating a new whole. It involves combining various materials and elements onto a single surface. In graphic design, this often translates to combining:</p>
            <ul>
