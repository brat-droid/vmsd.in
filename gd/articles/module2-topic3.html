        <h1 class="article-title">Color Theory</h1>
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Color is arguably one of the most powerful and emotive elements in graphic design. It can evoke feelings, convey messages, attract attention, and establish brand identity. Understanding <strong>Color Theory</strong> is fundamental for any designer, as it provides a framework for how colors interact, how they are perceived, and how to use them effectively to achieve specific design goals.</p>

            <h2>The Color Wheel</h2>
            <p>The color wheel is a foundational tool in color theory, organizing colors based on their relationships to one another. It typically includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Colors:</strong> Red, Yellow, Blue (RYB) in traditional art, or Red, Green, Blue (RGB) for light-based digital displays, and Cyan, Magenta, Yellow (CMY) for print. These are the foundational colors from which all others are mixed.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Colors:</strong> Created by mixing two primary colors (e.g., Green from Blue and Yellow, Orange from Red and Yellow, Purple from Red and Blue).</li>
                <li><strong>Tertiary Colors:</strong> Created by mixing a primary and a secondary color (e.g., Red-Orange, Blue-Green).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Color Harmonies (Color Schemes)</h2>
            <p>Color harmonies are combinations of colors that are considered aesthetically pleasing and balanced. Understanding these schemes helps designers create cohesive and impactful palettes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complementary Colors:</strong> Colors directly opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g., Red and Green, Blue and Orange). They create high contrast and visual excitement, often used to make elements pop.</li>
                <li><strong>Analogous Colors:</strong> Colors that are next to each other on the color wheel (e.g., Blue, Blue-Green, Green). They create a sense of harmony and tranquility, often found in nature.</li>
                <li><strong>Triadic Colors:</strong> Three colors equally spaced on the color wheel (e.g., Red, Yellow, Blue). This scheme offers strong visual contrast while maintaining balance and richness.</li>
                <li><strong>Monochromatic Colors:</strong> Different shades, tints, and tones of a single color. This creates a subtle, sophisticated, and cohesive look.</li>
                <li><strong>Split-Complementary Colors:</strong> A base color and the two colors adjacent to its complement. This offers high contrast but with less tension than a direct complementary scheme.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Psychology of Color</h2>
            <p>Colors carry psychological associations and cultural meanings that can significantly influence how a design is perceived. While interpretations can vary, some common associations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Red:</strong> Passion, energy, urgency, danger, love.</li>
                <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Trust, calm, stability, professionalism, sadness.</li>
                <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Happiness, optimism, warning, energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Green:</strong> Nature, growth, freshness, health, wealth.</li>
                <li><strong>Orange:</strong> Enthusiasm, creativity, warmth, youthfulness.</li>
                <li><strong>Purple:</strong> Royalty, luxury, creativity, mystery.</li>
                <li><strong>Black:</strong> Sophistication, power, mystery, grief.</li>
                <li><strong>White:</strong> Purity, cleanliness, simplicity, innocence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Designers leverage color psychology to evoke specific emotions, reinforce brand messaging, and guide user behavior.</p>

            <h2>Color Models (RGB vs. CMYK)</h2>
            <p>It's crucial for designers to understand the difference between color models based on their output medium:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RGB (Red, Green, Blue):</strong> An additive color model used for light-emitting displays (screens, monitors, TVs). Colors are created by adding light, and combining all three at full intensity produces white. Designs intended for digital viewing should be created in RGB.</li>
                <li><strong>CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black):</strong> A subtractive color model used for print. Colors are created by subtracting light from white paper using inks. Combining all four inks produces black. Designs intended for print should be converted to CMYK to ensure accurate color reproduction, as RGB colors can appear dull or different when printed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Mastering color theory allows designers to make informed decisions that enhance the aesthetic appeal, emotional impact, and communicative power of their work.</p>
