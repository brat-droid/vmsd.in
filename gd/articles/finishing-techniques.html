            <h2>Common Finishing Techniques</h2>
            <p>Here are some of the most widely used finishing techniques:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lamination:</strong> Applying a thin, protective plastic film (matte, gloss, or soft-touch) over the printed surface. Increases durability, water resistance, and enhances color.</li>
                <li><strong>Varnishing:</strong> Applying a clear liquid coating (gloss, matte, satin) over the printed surface. Provides protection and can create subtle visual effects. Can be applied overall or spot (only on specific areas).</li>
                <li><strong>UV Coating:</strong> A liquid compound applied to the paper and then cured with ultraviolet light. Creates a very high-gloss, durable finish. Can also be spot UV for selective shine.</li>
                <li><strong>Embossing & Debossing:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Embossing:</strong> Creates a raised image or text on the paper surface, adding a tactile and dimensional effect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Debossing:</strong> Creates a depressed (indented) image or text on the paper surface.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Foil Stamping:</strong> Applying a metallic (gold, silver, copper) or pigmented foil to a surface using heat and pressure. Creates a luxurious, reflective effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Die-Cutting:</strong> Using a sharp steel rule die to cut paper into custom shapes, beyond standard rectangles. Used for unique packaging, intricate designs, or special effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring/Creasing:</strong> Creating a crease in thick paper to facilitate a clean, straight fold without cracking the paper.</li>
                <li><strong>Perforation:</strong> Creating a line of small holes to allow for easy tearing (e.g., tear-off coupons, ticket stubs).</li>
                <li><strong>Binding:</strong> Methods of holding multiple pages together (e.g., saddle stitch, perfect bound, spiral, wire-o, case bound).</li>
            </ul>
