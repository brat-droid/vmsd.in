        <h1 class="article-title">Figma & Adobe XD: Designing for User Experience (UI/UX)</h1>
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>In the rapidly expanding digital world, where interactions increasingly happen through screens, the design of user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX) has become paramount. UI/UX designers are the architects of digital products, ensuring that websites, mobile apps, and software are not only visually appealing but also intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable to use. To achieve this, they rely on specialized tools that facilitate wireframing, prototyping, collaboration, and user testing. Among the leading contenders in this space are Figma and Adobe XD, both powerful platforms that have revolutionized the UI/UX design workflow.</p>

            <p>This module will introduce you to the core concepts of UI/UX design and explore the functionalities of Figma and Adobe XD. Understanding these tools and the principles behind user-centered design is crucial for creating digital products that resonate with users, drive engagement, and achieve business objectives in today's mobile-first and digitally-driven landscape.</p>

            <h2>Understanding UI/UX Design: The User-Centric Approach</h2>
            <p>While often used interchangeably, UI and UX refer to distinct but interconnected aspects of digital product design:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Experience (UX) Design:</strong> Focuses on the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service. It's about how a user feels, how easy it is to use, and how efficiently they can achieve their goals. UX designers conduct research, create user flows, wireframes, and prototypes, and test designs to ensure usability and satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>User Interface (UI) Design:</strong> Focuses on the visual and interactive elements of a product. It's about how the product looks and how users interact with it. UI designers are responsible for the aesthetics, layout, typography, color schemes, buttons, icons, and other visual components that users see and click on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In essence, UX is the journey, and UI is the car. A great car (UI) with a bad road (UX) leads to a frustrating experience. A smooth road (UX) with a well-designed car (UI) leads to a delightful journey.</p>
