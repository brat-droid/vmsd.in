            <h1>Asset Allocation</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Asset allocation is the strategy of dividing your investment portfolio among different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. It is widely considered the most important decision in the investment process.</p>

            <h2>The Importance of Asset Allocation</h2>
            <p>Numerous studies have shown that asset allocation is the single biggest determinant of a portfolio's long-term returns and volatility. The decision of how much to allocate to stocks versus bonds will have a far greater impact on your results than the specific stocks or bonds you choose. The goal is to create a mix that aligns with your <span class="highlight">risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals</span>.</p>

            <h2>Major Asset Classes</h2>
            <p>The primary asset classes used in portfolio construction are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equities (Stocks):</strong> Offer the highest potential for long-term growth but also come with the most volatility.</li>
                <li><strong>Fixed Income (Bonds):</strong> Generally less risky than stocks and provide a steady stream of income. They often perform well when stocks are performing poorly, providing a stabilizing effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> Includes savings accounts, money market funds, and short-term Treasury bills. They are very safe but offer the lowest returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> A broad category that includes assets like real estate, commodities, and private equity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Determining Your Asset Mix</h2>
            <p>Your personal asset allocation should be based on your specific circumstances. A young investor with a long time horizon can afford to take on more risk and would typically have a higher allocation to stocks. A retiree who is drawing income from their portfolio would have a higher allocation to bonds and cash to reduce volatility and preserve capital. A common rule of thumb is the "110 rule," which suggests subtracting your age from 110 to determine the percentage of your portfolio that should be in stocks.</p>
