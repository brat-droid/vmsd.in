            <h2>Who Are the Key Players?</h2>
            <p>The smooth functioning of financial markets depends on the interaction between various participants. These can be broadly categorized into the <span class="highlight">buy-side</span> (those who buy securities) and the <span class="highlight">sell-side</span> (those who issue, sell, and trade securities).</p>

            <h2>The Buy-Side</h2>
            <p>The buy-side includes institutions and individuals who purchase investment securities for their own accounts or for others. Their goal is to make a return on their investments.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Individual Investors:</strong> Also known as retail investors, these are individuals investing for their own personal goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional Investors:</strong> These are organizations that pool large sums of money and invest those sums in securities. Examples include mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Sell-Side</h2>
            <p>The sell-side includes firms that provide a range of financial services, including issuing, selling, and trading securities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Investment Banks:</strong> They help companies and governments raise capital by underwriting and issuing new securities. They also advise on mergers and acquisitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Brokers and Dealers:</strong> A broker executes trades on behalf of others, while a dealer trades for their own account. Many firms, known as broker-dealers, do both.</li>
            </ul>
