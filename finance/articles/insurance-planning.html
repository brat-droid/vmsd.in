            <h2>The Role of Insurance in Financial Planning</h2>
            <p>Insurance is a form of <span class="highlight">risk management</span>. By paying a regular premium to an insurance company, you transfer the risk of a large financial loss from yourself to them. Proper insurance planning ensures that a single catastrophic event, like a serious illness or accident, doesn't wipe out your savings and destroy your financial future.</p>

            <h2>Key Types of Insurance to Consider</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health Insurance:</strong> Covers medical and surgical expenses. Absolutely essential in most countries to avoid crippling medical debt.</li>
                <li><strong>Life Insurance:</strong> Provides a financial payout to your designated beneficiaries upon your death. Crucial if you have dependents who rely on your income.</li>
                <li><strong>Auto Insurance:</strong> Protects you against financial loss if you're in a car accident. It is legally required in most places.</li>
                <li><strong>Homeowner's/Renter's Insurance:</strong> Covers damage to your property and liability for accidents in your home.</li>
                <li><strong>Disability Insurance:</strong> Replaces a portion of your income if you become unable to work due to illness or injury.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Assessing Your Coverage Needs</h2>
            <p>Your insurance needs will change throughout your life. When you're young and single, your needs might be minimal. However, buying a home, getting married, or having children will significantly increase your need for coverage. Regularly review your policies and life circumstances to ensure you are adequately protected without being over-insured.</p>
