            <h1>Forex & Crypto</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">The foreign exchange (Forex) and cryptocurrency markets are two of the largest and most volatile financial markets in the world. This article introduces both.</p>

            <h2>The Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market</h2>
            <p>The Forex market is a global, decentralized market for the trading of currencies. It is the largest financial market in the world by trading volume. Currencies are always traded in pairs (e.g., EUR/USD), and the exchange rate represents how much of the second currency you need to buy one unit of the first. The market is driven by a combination of <span class="highlight">interest rate differentials, economic data, and geopolitical events</span>.</p>

            <h2>Introduction to Cryptocurrency</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are digital or virtual tokens that use cryptography for security. They are decentralized and typically based on <span class="highlight">blockchain technology</span>, a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. Unlike traditional currencies, they are not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.</p>

            <h2>Trading and Volatility</h2>
            <p>Both Forex and crypto markets are known for their high liquidity and near 24/7 trading hours. However, they are also characterized by significant <span class="highlight">volatility</span>. Prices can move very quickly, offering the potential for high returns but also posing a substantial risk of loss. Due to this volatility, trading in these markets is often considered speculative and is not suitable for all investors.</p>
