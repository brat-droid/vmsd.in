            <h1>Ratio Analysis</h1>

            <h2>What is Ratio Analysis?</h2>
            <p>Financial ratios are mathematical comparisons of financial statement accounts or categories. These ratios allow investors to get a quick and standardized look at a company's financial health and performance. Ratios are most useful when compared against a company's own historical performance or against the ratios of its competitors in the same industry.</p>

            <h2>Key Categories of Financial Ratios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Liquidity Ratios:</strong> These measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. The <span class="highlight">Current Ratio</span> (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) is a common example.</li>
                <li><strong>Profitability Ratios:</strong> These measure a company's ability to generate profits from its sales or assets. The <span class="highlight">Net Profit Margin</span> (Net Income / Revenue) is a key profitability ratio.</li>
                <li><strong>Leverage Ratios:</strong> These measure the extent to which a company is using debt to finance its assets. The <span class="highlight">Debt-to-Equity Ratio</span> (Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity) is a widely used leverage ratio.</li>
                <li><strong>Valuation Ratios:</strong> These help investors assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. The <span class="highlight">Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio</span> (Stock Price per Share / Earnings per Share) is the most famous valuation ratio.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Putting Ratios in Context</h2>
            <p>A single ratio in isolation provides limited information. The true power of ratio analysis comes from trend analysis (how a ratio changes over time) and industry analysis (how a company's ratios compare to industry averages). This comparative analysis helps to paint a much clearer picture of a company's strengths and weaknesses.</p>
