            <h2>The Importance of Visualizing Price</h2>
            <p>Charts provide a graphical representation of a security's price and volume over time. By visualizing this data, analysts can identify patterns, trends, and potential trading opportunities that might not be apparent from a simple table of numbers. The type of chart used can influence how this information is interpreted.</p>

            <h2>Common Chart Types</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Line Chart:</strong> The simplest type of chart, which connects a series of closing prices over a period. It provides a clean, easy-to-read view of the general price trend.</li>
                <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> This chart shows the opening, high, low, and closing (OHLC) prices for a specific period. The vertical line represents the high and low, while small horizontal lines on the left and right mark the open and close.</li>
                <li><strong>Candlestick Chart:</strong> Originating from Japan, candlestick charts also show the OHLC prices but in a more visually intuitive way. The "body" of the candle represents the range between the open and close, and it is colored to indicate whether the price went up or down. The "wicks" show the high and low. This is the most popular chart type among traders today.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Choosing the Right Chart</h2>
            <p>While line charts are good for seeing the big picture trend, <span class="highlight">candlestick charts</span> provide the most information for detailed analysis. The color and shape of the candlesticks can form patterns that many traders use to make short-term predictions about price movements. Understanding how to read a candlestick chart is a fundamental skill in technical analysis.</p>
