            <h1>Support & Resistance</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Support and resistance are core concepts in technical analysis that identify key price levels on a chart. This article explains how to find and use these levels.</p>

            <h2>What is Support?</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Support</span> is a price level where a downtrend can be expected to pause due to a concentration of demand or buying interest. As the price of a security drops, demand for the shares increases, thus forming the support line. It can be visualized as a floor that is supporting the price.</p>

            <h2>What is Resistance?</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Resistance</span> is a price level where an uptrend can be expected to pause temporarily, due to a concentration of supply or selling interest. As the price of a security rises, selling pressure increases, thus forming the resistance line. It can be visualized as a ceiling that is preventing the price from moving higher.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Support and Resistance</h2>
            <p>Support and resistance levels are identified by looking for historical price points where the market has reversed. To draw a support or resistance level, you need to find at least two points where the price has bounced. The more times the price has tested a level without breaking it, the stronger that level is considered to be.</p>

            <h2>The Role Reversal Principle</h2>
            <p>A key principle of support and resistance is that once a level is broken, its role can reverse. If a support level is broken, it can become a new resistance level. Conversely, if a resistance level is broken, it can become a new support level. This phenomenon occurs because market psychology shifts after a significant breakout.</p>
