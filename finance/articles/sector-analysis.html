            <h1>Sector Analysis</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Sector analysis is the process of evaluating the economic and financial conditions of a specific sector of the economy. This article explains why it's a crucial part of investment research.</p>

            <h2>What Are Market Sectors?</h2>
            <p>The stock market is typically divided into a number of broad sectors, which group together companies that are in similar businesses. The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) defines 11 sectors, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Information Technology</li>
                <li>Health Care</li>
                <li>Financials</li>
                <li>Consumer Discretionary</li>
                <li>Communication Services</li>
                <li>Industrials</li>
                <li>Consumer Staples</li>
                <li>Energy</li>
                <li>Utilities</li>
                <li>Real Estate</li>
                <li>Materials</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why is Sector Analysis Important?</h2>
            <p>A company's performance is heavily influenced by the health of its sector. A rising tide lifts all boats, and a strong sector can boost the performance of even mediocre companies within it. Conversely, a struggling sector can be a headwind for even the best-run companies. Sector analysis helps investors identify which parts of the economy are growing and which are facing challenges. This <span class="highlight">top-down</span> approach can help narrow the universe of potential investments.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing a Sector</h2>
            <p>Analyzing a sector involves looking at its growth prospects, the level of competition, the regulatory environment, and its sensitivity to business cycles. For example, the <span class="highlight">Consumer Staples</span> sector tends to be defensive and performs well during economic downturns, while the <span class="highlight">Consumer Discretionary</span> sector is cyclical and performs well during economic expansions.</p>
