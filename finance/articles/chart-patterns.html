            <h1>Chart Patterns</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Chart patterns are formations that appear on a price chart that have a predictive value. This article covers the two main categories of chart patterns.</p>

            <h2>What Are Chart Patterns?</h2>
            <p>In technical analysis, a chart pattern is a distinct formation on a chart that creates a trading signal, or a sign of future price movements. Chart patterns are the basis of technical analysis and are believed to be a reflection of the collective psychology of market participants. They can be categorized as either <span class="highlight">reversal</span> or <span class="highlight">continuation</span> patterns.</p>

            <h2>Reversal Patterns</h2>
            <p>Reversal patterns signal that a prevailing trend is likely to change direction. They indicate that the sentiment of the market is shifting.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Head and Shoulders:</strong> A pattern that resembles a baseline with three peaks, the outside two are close in height and the middle is highest. It signals a potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish. An inverse head and shoulders signals the opposite.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Top / Double Bottom:</strong> A double top is a bearish reversal pattern where the price makes two consecutive peaks at roughly the same level. A double bottom is the bullish equivalent.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Continuation Patterns</h2>
            <p>Continuation patterns signal that a prevailing trend is likely to continue after a temporary pause or consolidation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Triangles:</strong> These can be symmetrical, ascending, or descending. They represent a period of consolidation where buyers and sellers are in a temporary state of equilibrium before the price breaks out and continues the trend.</li>
                <li><strong>Flags and Pennants:</strong> These are short-term continuation patterns that form after a sharp price movement. They represent a brief pause in the market before the trend resumes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Importance of Confirmation</h2>
            <p>No chart pattern is foolproof. It is crucial to wait for a pattern to be <span class="highlight">confirmed</span> before acting on it. Confirmation typically comes in the form of a breakout, where the price moves decisively above a resistance level or below a support level that defines the pattern. This breakout should ideally occur on increased volume.</p>
