            <h1>Working Capital</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Working capital is a measure of a company's short-term liquidity and operational efficiency. This article explains how it's calculated and why it's important.</p>

            <h2>What is Working Capital?</h2>
            <p>Working capital is the difference between a company's <span class="highlight">current assets</span> and its <span class="highlight">current liabilities</span>. Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash within one year, such as cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. Current liabilities are obligations that are due within one year, such as accounts payable and short-term debt.</p>
            <p>The formula is: <span class="highlight">Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities</span></p>

            <h2>Interpreting Working Capital</h2>
            <p>Positive working capital indicates that a company has enough short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities. Negative working capital, on the other hand, can be a sign of financial distress. However, the ideal level of working capital varies by industry. A company with a very predictable cash flow may be able to operate with a lower level of working capital.</p>

            <h2>The Cash Conversion Cycle</h2>
            <p>Effective working capital management involves managing the <span class="highlight">cash conversion cycle (CCC)</span>. The CCC is the length of time it takes for a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash. A shorter cash conversion cycle is generally better, as it means the company needs less time to generate cash. This involves efficiently managing inventory, collecting accounts receivable quickly, and optimizing payment terms with suppliers.</p>
