            <h2>What is Investing?</h2>
            <p>Investing involves committing money or capital to an endeavor with the expectation of obtaining an additional income or profit. Unlike saving, which is about setting money aside in a safe place, investing involves taking on some level of <span class="highlight">risk</span> with the goal of achieving higher <span class="highlight">returns</span>. The primary goal is to make your money work for you.</p>

            <h2>Common Types of Investments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Also known as equities, stocks represent ownership in a publicly-traded company. They offer the potential for high growth but also come with higher risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> A bond is essentially a loan you make to a government or corporation. In return, they pay you periodic interest payments. Bonds are generally considered safer than stocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutual Funds & ETFs:</strong> These are collections of stocks, bonds, and other assets, bundled together. They offer instant diversification, which is a key strategy for managing risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> This can include owning physical property or investing in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Relationship Between Risk and Return</h2>
            <p>A fundamental principle of investing is the <span class="highlight">risk-return tradeoff</span>. This means that investments with higher potential returns typically come with higher risk. Understanding your personal risk tolerance is crucial before you start investing. A diversified portfolio, which spreads your money across different asset classes, is the most common strategy for managing this risk.</p>
