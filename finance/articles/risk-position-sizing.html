            <h2>The Importance of Risk Management</h2>
            <p>The number one job of a trader is not to make money, but to manage risk. Without a solid risk management plan, even a profitable trading strategy will eventually lead to ruin. The goal is to ensure that you can survive a string of losing trades and live to trade another day. This involves defining your risk per trade and determining the correct position size.</p>

            <h2>The 1% Rule</h2>
            <p>A widely accepted rule of thumb is to never risk more than <span class="highlight">1% of your trading capital</span> on a single trade. For example, if you have a $20,000 trading account, you should not risk more than $200 on any given trade. This ensures that a series of losses will not significantly deplete your capital, allowing you to stay in the game.</p>

            <h2>Determining Your Stop-Loss</h2>
            <p>Before entering any trade, you must know where you will exit if the trade goes against you. This is your <span class="highlight">stop-loss</span>. Your stop-loss should be placed at a logical level based on your technical analysis (e.g., below a key support level), not based on an arbitrary dollar amount. The distance between your entry price and your stop-loss price determines your risk on the trade in points or pips.</p>

            <h2>Calculating Your Position Size</h2>
            <p>Once you know your risk per trade (e.g., 1% of your account) and your stop-loss distance, you can calculate the correct position size. The formula is:</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Position Size = (Account Size * Risk % per Trade) / (Stop-Loss Distance * Value per Point)</span></p>
            <p>By calculating your position size on every trade, you ensure that you are risking a consistent, small percentage of your account, regardless of the trade setup. This is the cornerstone of professional risk management.</p>
