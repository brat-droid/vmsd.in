            <h2>What is Price Action Trading?</h2>
            <p>Price action trading is a methodology that involves making all of your trading decisions based on the analysis of a "naked" price chart. This means trading without the use of lagging technical indicators like the RSI or MACD. Price action traders believe that the price movement itself provides all the information needed to make a profitable trade. They focus on analyzing <span class="highlight">candlestick patterns, trends, support and resistance levels, and chart patterns</span>.</p>

            <h2>Key Components of Price Action Analysis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trend Analysis:</strong> Identifying whether the market is in an uptrend (a series of higher highs and higher lows) or a downtrend (lower highs and lower lows). Trading with the trend is a core principle.</li>
                <li><strong>Support and Resistance:</strong> Identifying key horizontal levels where the price has previously reversed. These levels act as barriers and can be strategic points to enter or exit trades.</li>
                <li><strong>Candlestick Patterns:</strong> Analyzing the shape and formation of individual candlesticks or small groups of them to gauge market sentiment. Patterns like the pin bar or the engulfing bar can signal potential reversals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Psychology of Price Action</h2>
            <p>At its core, price action reflects the collective beliefs and actions of all market participants. Every candlestick tells a story about the battle between buyers (bulls) and sellers (bears) during a specific period. By learning to read this story, price action traders aim to anticipate the market's next move based on the patterns of human behavior reflected in the price chart.</p>
