            <h2>What Are Commodities?</h2>
            <p>Commodities are raw materials or primary agricultural products that can be bought and sold, such as gold, oil, and coffee. The key characteristic of a commodity is that it is <span class="highlight">standardized and interchangeable</span> with another commodity of the same type. For example, one barrel of Brent crude oil is the same as another, regardless of who produced it.</p>

            <h2>Major Categories of Commodities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Includes crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline. These are fundamental to the global economy.</li>
                <li><strong>Metals:</strong> Can be divided into precious metals (like gold and silver) and industrial metals (like copper and aluminum).</li>
                <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Includes soft commodities like coffee, cocoa, and sugar, as well as grains like wheat and corn.</li>
                <li><strong>Livestock:</strong> Includes cattle and hogs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Invest in Commodities</h2>
            <p>Directly buying and storing commodities can be impractical for most investors. Instead, investors typically gain exposure to the commodities market through <span class="highlight">futures contracts</span>, which are agreements to buy or sell a specific quantity of a commodity at a set price on a future date. Investors can also buy stocks of companies that produce commodities or invest in commodity-focused Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).</p>
