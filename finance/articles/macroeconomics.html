            <h1>Macroeconomics</h1>

            <h2>What is Macroeconomics?</h2>
            <p>While microeconomics focuses on individual agents and markets, macroeconomics looks at the bigger picture. It examines economy-wide phenomena such as <span class="highlight">Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</span>, <span class="highlight">inflation</span>, <span class="highlight">unemployment</span>, and <span class="highlight">interest rates</span>. Understanding these concepts is crucial for investors, as they have a significant impact on corporate earnings, stock valuations, and bond prices.</p>

            <h2>Key Macroeconomic Indicators</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</strong> The total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. A growing GDP indicates a healthy, expanding economy.</li>
                <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling. Central banks often aim for a target inflation rate (e.g., 2%) to maintain price stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> The percentage of the labor force that is jobless and actively looking for employment. A low unemployment rate is a sign of a strong economy.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> The cost of borrowing money. Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, set key interest rates to influence economic activity. Higher rates can cool down an overheating economy, while lower rates can stimulate growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Business Cycle</h2>
            <p>Economies naturally move through cycles of expansion and contraction. The four stages of the business cycle are <span class="highlight">expansion, peak, contraction (recession), and trough</span>. Macroeconomic data helps policymakers and investors understand where the economy is in the business cycle and what might be coming next.</p>
