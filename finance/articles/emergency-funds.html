            <h2>Why You Need an Emergency Fund</h2>
            <p>Life is unpredictable. An unexpected job loss, a medical crisis, or urgent home repairs can happen to anyone. An <span class="highlight">emergency fund</span> is a stash of money set aside specifically for these unforeseen expenses, preventing you from derailing your financial goals or going into debt when crisis strikes.</p>

            <h2>How Much Should You Save?</h2>
            <p>Financial experts generally recommend saving <span class="highlight">3 to 6 months'</span> worth of essential living expenses. This includes costs like rent or mortgage, utilities, food, and transportation. The exact amount depends on your job stability, income, and personal risk tolerance. If you have a variable income or dependents, aiming for a larger fund is a wise strategy.</p>

            <h2>Building Your Fund</h2>
            <p>Start by setting a small, achievable goal, like saving your first $500. Automate your savings by setting up regular transfers from your checking account to a separate, high-yield savings account. This keeps the money accessible but not so easy to spend on non-emergencies. Cut back on non-essential spending temporarily to accelerate your progress.</p>
