    <h1>Soft Bodies, Constraints, and Joints in Three.js</h1>
    <p>Three.js itself does not natively support soft body physics, constraints, or joints. To implement these advanced physics features, you need to integrate a third-party physics engine. The most commonly used and capable engine for this purpose in the Three.js ecosystem is <b>Ammo.js</b>, which is a WebAssembly port of the Bullet Physics library.</p>

    <h2>Soft Bodies</h2>
    <p>Soft bodies are deformable objects that can stretch, bend, and compress, simulating materials like cloth, rubber, or jelly. In Three.js, soft body simulations are achieved by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Integrating Ammo.js:</b> You need to include the Ammo.js library in your project.</li>
        <li><b>Creating a Physics World:</b> Initialize an Ammo.js physics world, specifically a <code>btSoftRigidDynamicsWorld</code>, which is designed to handle both rigid and soft bodies.</li>
        <li><b>Defining Soft Body Geometry:</b> Create a Three.js mesh for your soft body. This mesh's vertices will be influenced by the physics simulation.</li>
        <li><b>Creating an Ammo.js Soft Body:</b> Use Ammo.js functions to create a corresponding soft body object based on your Three.js geometry, defining properties like mass, pressure, and stiffness.</li>
        <li><b>Simulation Loop:</b> In your animation loop, you'll step the Ammo.js physics simulation. After each step, you retrieve the updated vertex positions from the Ammo.js soft body and apply them to your Three.js mesh's geometry.</li>
        <li><b>Anchoring:</b> You can anchor specific points of a soft body to other rigid bodies or static points in the scene, allowing for complex interactions.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Constraints (Joints)</h2>
    <p>Constraints, often referred to as joints in physics engines, define how two or more rigid bodies are connected or how a rigid body is restricted in its movement. Ammo.js provides various types of constraints, directly ported from Bullet Physics, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Point-to-Point Constraint (<code>btPoint2PointConstraint</code>):</b> Limits the translation of two rigid bodies so that their local pivot points match in world space. Useful for creating chains.</li>
        <li><b>Hinge Constraint (<code>btHingeConstraint</code>):</b> Simulates a hinge or a door, allowing rotation around a single axis.</li>
        <li><b>Slider Constraint (<code>btSliderConstraint</code>):</b> Allows movement along a single axis and rotation around that same axis, similar to a piston.</li>
        <li><b>Cone Twist Constraint (<code>btConeTwistConstraint</code>):</b> Useful for simulating ball-and-socket joints, allowing rotation within a cone.</li>
        <li><b>Generic 6-DOF Constraint (<code>btGeneric6DofConstraint</code>):</b> A highly versatile constraint that allows you to limit movement and rotation along and around any of the six degrees of freedom.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Implementation Steps for Constraints (Conceptual):</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Create rigid bodies using Ammo.js for the objects you want to connect.</li>
        <li>Define pivot points and axes for each body involved in the constraint.</li>
        <li>Instantiate the desired Ammo.js constraint type, passing in the rigid bodies and the defined pivot points/axes.</li>
        <li>Add the created constraint to your Ammo.js physics world.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conceptual Example: Basic Physics World Setup (Requires Ammo.js)</h2>
    <p>This is a conceptual example demonstrating the basic setup for a physics world using Ammo.js, which is necessary for soft bodies, constraints, and joints. A full implementation of soft bodies or complex joints is extensive and beyond a simple iframe example.</p>

    <pre><code>import * as THREE from 'three';
// You would typically load Ammo.js from a CDN or local file
// import Ammo from './ammo.js'; 

// Initialize Ammo.js (conceptual - actual initialization is asynchronous)
// Ammo().then(function (AmmoLib) {
//     Ammo = AmmoLib;
//     initPhysics();
// });

let physicsWorld;

function initPhysics() {
    // Physics configuration
    const collisionConfiguration = new Ammo.btDefaultCollisionConfiguration();
    const dispatcher = new Ammo.btCollisionDispatcher(collisionConfiguration);
    const broadphase = new Ammo.btDbvtBroadphase();
    const solver = new Ammo.btSequentialImpulseConstraintSolver();
    physicsWorld = new Ammo.btDiscreteDynamicsWorld(dispatcher, broadphase, solver, collisionConfiguration);
    physicsWorld.setGravity(new Ammo.btVector3(0, -9.82, 0)); // Set gravity

    // For soft bodies, you would use btSoftRigidDynamicsWorld
    // physicsWorld = new Ammo.btSoftRigidDynamicsWorld(dispatcher, broadphase, solver, collisionConfiguration, new Ammo.btDefaultSoftBodySolver());

    // Create a ground plane (rigid body)
    const groundShape = new Ammo.btBoxShape(new Ammo.btVector3(50, 1, 50));
    const groundTransform = new Ammo.btTransform();
    groundTransform.setIdentity();
    groundTransform.setOrigin(new Ammo.btVector3(0, -1, 0));
    const groundMass = 0; // Static body
    const groundMotionState = new Ammo.btDefaultMotionState(groundTransform);
    const groundRigidBodyInfo = new Ammo.btRigidBodyConstructionInfo(groundMass, groundMotionState, groundShape, new Ammo.btVector3(0, 0, 0));
    const groundRigidBody = new Ammo.btRigidBody(groundRigidBodyInfo);
    physicsWorld.addRigidBody(groundRigidBody);

    console.log("Physics world initialized!");
}

// Animation loop (conceptual - would include physicsWorld.stepSimulation)
// function animate() {
//     requestAnimationFrame(animate);
//     if (physicsWorld) {
//         physicsWorld.stepSimulation(1 / 60, 10); // Step physics simulation
//         // Update Three.js objects based on physics results
//     }
//     renderer.render(scene, camera);
// }
// animate();

// Note: A full working example requires including the Ammo.js library and proper setup.
