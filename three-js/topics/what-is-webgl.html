    <h2 class="section-title">The Foundation of 3D Graphics in Your Browser</h2>
    <p>WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. It is essentially a low-level API that allows you to directly interact with the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) of your device, enabling hardware-accelerated rendering.</p>
    
    <h3>How WebGL Works</h3>
    <p>WebGL is based on OpenGL ES 2.0, a subset of the OpenGL API designed for embedded systems. It works by providing a set of functions that allow you to send commands to the GPU. These commands typically involve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Shaders:</b> Small programs that run directly on the GPU, responsible for rendering graphics. Vertex shaders process vertex data (position, color, etc.), and fragment shaders determine the color of each pixel.</li>
      <li><b>Buffers:</b> Used to store data (like vertex positions, colors, texture coordinates) that is sent to the GPU.</li>
      <li><b>Textures:</b> Images applied to the surface of 3D objects to give them detail and realism.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Role of Three.js and React Three Fiber</h3>
    <p>While WebGL provides the raw power for 3D rendering, it can be quite complex to work with directly. This is where libraries like Three.js come in. Three.js is a high-level 3D library that simplifies WebGL development by providing a more intuitive API for creating and manipulating 3D objects, lights, and cameras.</p>
    <p>React Three Fiber then builds on top of Three.js, allowing you to use React's component-based approach to build your Three.js scenes. So, the stack essentially looks like this: **WebGL (low-level) &lt;- Three.js (mid-level) &lt;- React Three Fiber (high-level)**.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Interactive Data Visualizations</h3>
    <p>Many modern interactive data visualizations, especially those involving complex 3D graphs or animated elements, are powered by WebGL. Libraries like Three.js make it feasible to create these rich experiences without needing to write thousands of lines of low-level WebGL code. For example, a 3D globe showing real-time data flows would heavily rely on WebGL for its rendering capabilities.</p>
