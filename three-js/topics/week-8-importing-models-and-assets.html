    <h2 class="section-title">Bringing External 3D Models and Textures into Your R3F Scenes</h2>
    <p>While creating basic geometries is useful, real-world 3D applications often rely on complex models and textures created in external 3D software. This week, you'll learn how to efficiently import and manage these assets within your React Three Fiber projects, bringing your scenes to a new level of detail and realism.</p>
    
    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="using-gltf-models.html">Using glTF models</a> - Master the industry-standard format for 3D model transmission and its integration in R3F.</li>
      <li><a href="handling-animations.html">Handling animations (useAnimations)</a> - Learn to play, pause, and control animations embedded within your 3D models.</li>
      <li><a href="texture-loading-with-usetexture.html">Texture loading with useTexture</a> - Efficiently load and apply various types of textures to your materials.</li>
      <li><a href="hosting-and-loading-3d-assets.html">Hosting & loading 3D assets</a> - Best practices for serving and loading large 3D files for optimal performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Will Achieve This Week:</h3>
    <p>By the end of this week, you will be proficient in importing and managing external 3D models and textures, including handling complex animations. This skill is crucial for building professional-grade 3D web applications that leverage pre-made or custom-designed assets, significantly expanding the visual possibilities of your projects.</p>
