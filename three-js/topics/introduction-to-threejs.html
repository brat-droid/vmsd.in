    <h2 class="section-title">The Popular JavaScript 3D Library</h2>
    <p>Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. It aims to simplify the process of creating complex 3D animations and interactive experiences on the web.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features of Three.js</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Scenes, Cameras, and Renderers:</b> Provides the core components for setting up a 3D environment.</li>
      <li><b>Geometries and Materials:</b> A wide range of built-in geometries (cubes, spheres, etc.) and materials (basic, standard, physical) to define the shape and appearance of objects.</li>
      <li><b>Lights:</b> Various light types (ambient, directional, point, spot) to illuminate your scenes realistically.</li>
      <li><b>Loaders:</b> Supports loading various 3D model formats (GLTF, OBJ, FBX) created in 3D modeling software.</li>
      <li><b>Post-processing Effects:</b> Allows for advanced visual effects like bloom, depth of field, and anti-aliasing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Use Three.js?</h3>
    <p>Three.js abstracts away the complexities of raw WebGL, providing a higher-level API that is much easier to work with. This allows developers to focus on creating compelling 3D content rather than getting bogged down in low-level graphics programming. It's widely used for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interactive product configurators</li>
      <li>3D data visualizations</li>
      <li>Web-based games</li>
      <li>Architectural visualizations</li>
      <li>Educational tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Study: Google Arts & Culture</h3>
    <p>Google Arts & Culture uses Three.js to power many of its immersive 3D experiences, allowing users to explore historical sites, art installations, and cultural artifacts in a virtual environment. This demonstrates Three.js's capability to handle complex scenes and deliver rich, interactive content directly in the browser.</p>
