    <h2 class="section-title">Simulating Realistic Interactions in Your 3D World</h2>
    <p>Adding physics to your 3D scenes brings a new level of realism and interactivity. This week, you'll learn how to integrate a physics engine into your React Three Fiber projects, enabling objects to collide, react to forces, and behave realistically within your virtual environment.</p>
    
    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="integrating-react-three-rapier.html">Integrating @react-three/rapier (physics engine)</a> - Learn to set up and use a high-performance physics engine with R3F.</li>
      <li><a href="collision-detection.html">Collision detection</a> - Understand how to detect when 3D objects intersect and react to these events.</li>
      <li><a href="soft-bodies-constraints-and-joints.html">Soft bodies, constraints, and joints</a> - Explore advanced physics concepts for more complex simulations.</li>
      <li><a href="creating-physics-based-gameplay.html">Creating physics-based gameplay</a> - Apply physics principles to build interactive game mechanics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Will Achieve This Week:</h3>
    <p>By the end of this week, you will be able to create dynamic 3D scenes with realistic physics simulations. You'll understand how to implement collision detection, apply forces, and build interactive experiences where objects behave naturally, opening up possibilities for games, simulations, and more.</p>
