    <h2 class="section-title">Supercharging Your R3F Development with DREI and Debugging Tools</h2>
    <p>React Three Fiber is powerful on its own, but its ecosystem includes incredibly useful helper libraries that can significantly accelerate your development process. This week, we'll explore `@react-three/drei`, a collection of useful helpers and abstractions, and introduce debugging tools to streamline your workflow.</p>
    
    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="drei-and-helper-libraries.html">@react-three/drei: OrbitControls, Text, Environment</a> - Discover how DREI simplifies common tasks like camera controls, text rendering, and environment setup.</li>
      <li><a href="debugging-with-leva-stats.html">Debugging with Leva, Stats</a> - Learn to use powerful debugging tools to inspect your scene, tweak parameters, and monitor performance.</li>
      <li><a href="using-usetexture-usegltf-center-bounds.html">Using useTexture, useGLTF, Center, Bounds</a> - Explore more advanced DREI hooks for efficient texture and GLTF model loading, and utility components for centering and bounding objects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Will Achieve This Week:</h3>
    <p>By the end of this week, you'll be equipped with a suite of helper tools from DREI that will make common 3D development tasks much easier and faster. You'll also gain valuable debugging skills, allowing you to efficiently identify and resolve issues in your R3F projects, leading to a more productive development experience.</p>
