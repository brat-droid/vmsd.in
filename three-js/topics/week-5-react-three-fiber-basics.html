    <h2 class="section-title">Bridging React and Three.js: Your First Steps with R3F</h2>
    <p>This week marks a significant transition as we introduce React Three Fiber (R3F), a powerful library that allows you to build Three.js scenes using React components. This approach brings the benefits of React's declarative syntax and component-based architecture to 3D web development.</p>
    
    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="what-is-react-three-fiber.html">What is React Three Fiber?</a> - Understand the core concepts and advantages of R3F.</li>
      <li><a href="setup-with-vite-cra-nextjs.html">Setup with Vite / CRA / Next.js</a> - Learn how to integrate R3F into your existing React projects.</li>
      <li><a href="canvas-and-the-render-loop.html">&lt;Canvas /&gt; and the render loop</a> - Discover the central component for rendering R3F scenes.</li>
      <li><a href="mesh-box-geometry-mesh-standard-material.html">&lt;mesh&gt;, &lt;boxGeometry&gt;, &lt;meshStandardMaterial&gt;</a> - Revisit basic 3D objects using R3F's component-based syntax.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Will Achieve This Week:</h3>
    <p>By the end of this week, you will be able to set up a React Three Fiber project and create simple 3D scenes using React components. You'll appreciate how R3F simplifies 3D development by leveraging your existing React knowledge, making the process more intuitive and efficient.</p>
