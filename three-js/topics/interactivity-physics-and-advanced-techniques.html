    <h2 class="section-title">Bringing Your 3D Worlds to Life with Dynamic Interactions</h2>
    <p>Once you have a solid foundation in creating and managing 3D scenes, the next step is to make them interactive and dynamic. This phase of the curriculum focuses on adding user interaction, simulating realistic physics, and exploring advanced techniques to push the boundaries of your 3D web applications.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Areas Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>User Interactions:</b> Learn how to detect user input (clicks, hovers, drags) on 3D objects and implement responsive behaviors. This includes mastering raycasting in both Three.js and React Three Fiber.</li>
      <li><b>State Management in 3D:</b> Understand how to effectively manage the state of your complex 3D applications, ensuring smooth and predictable behavior as users interact with your scene.</li>
      <li><b>Advanced Animations and Effects:</b> Dive deeper into creating compelling motion with keyframe animations and tweening libraries. Explore visual enhancements like particle systems and post-processing effects to add polish and immersion.</li>
      <li><b>Physics Simulations:</b> Integrate physics engines to simulate realistic collisions, gravity, and other physical properties, enabling the creation of interactive games and simulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why These Skills Are Crucial:</h3>
    <p>Interactive 3D experiences are far more engaging than static ones. By mastering these techniques, you'll be able to build applications where users can manipulate objects, navigate environments, and experience realistic physical interactions. This opens up a vast array of possibilities, from interactive product configurators and architectural walkthroughs to web-based games and educational simulations.</p>

    <h3>Looking Ahead:</h3>
    <p>The skills learned in this phase are foundational for building truly immersive and functional 3D web applications. They will prepare you for the final phase, where you'll integrate your 3D scenes with traditional UI elements, optimize performance, and tackle real-world projects.</p>
