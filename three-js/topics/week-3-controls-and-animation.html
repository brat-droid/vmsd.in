    <h2 class="section-title">Bringing Interactivity and Motion to Your 3D Scenes</h2>
    <p>In Week 3, we shift our focus to making your 3D scenes interactive and dynamic. You'll learn how to allow users to control the camera and objects, and how to create smooth, continuous animations that bring your virtual worlds to life.</p>
    
    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="orbit-controls-drag-controls.html">OrbitControls, DragControls</a> - Implement intuitive camera and object manipulation.</li>
      <li><a href="basic-animation-loop.html">Basic animation loop (requestAnimationFrame)</a> - Understand the core mechanism for continuous animation.</li>
      <li><a href="rotation-scaling-and-position-updates.html">Rotation, scaling, and position updates</a> - Learn to programmatically animate object properties.</li>
      <li><a href="raycasting-and-object-interaction.html">Raycasting & object interaction</a> - Enable users to interact with 3D objects through mouse clicks and hovers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Will Achieve This Week:</h3>
    <p>By the end of this week, your 3D scenes will no longer be static. You'll be able to add user controls for navigation and interaction, and implement basic animations to create engaging and dynamic experiences. This is a crucial step towards building truly immersive web applications.</p>
