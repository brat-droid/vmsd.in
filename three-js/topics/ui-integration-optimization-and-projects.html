    <h2 class="section-title">Bringing It All Together: Polished 3D Applications for the Real World</h2>
    <p>This final phase of the curriculum focuses on the practical aspects of building and deploying high-performance 3D web applications. You'll learn how to seamlessly integrate your 3D scenes with traditional 2D user interfaces, optimize for various devices, and apply all your acquired knowledge to create impressive real-world projects.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Areas Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>UI Integration:</b> Master techniques for combining HTML/CSS-based UI elements (like menus, tooltips, and overlays) with your 3D scenes, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive user experience.</li>
      <li><b>Performance Optimization:</b> Learn critical strategies to ensure your 3D applications run smoothly across different devices. This includes reducing draw calls, optimizing assets, and leveraging advanced R3F features like instancing and lazy loading.</li>
      <li><b>Device Compatibility:</b> Understand how to adapt your 3D experiences for various platforms, including mobile devices and potentially VR/AR environments.</li>
      <li><b>Real-World Projects:</b> Apply all your skills to build complete, portfolio-worthy projects such as 3D product viewers, interactive landing pages, small games, or architectural walkthroughs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why These Skills Are Crucial:</h3>
    <p>Building a stunning 3D scene is only half the battle. For a 3D web application to be successful, it needs to be performant, accessible, and seamlessly integrated into the overall user experience. This phase equips you with the knowledge to deliver polished, production-ready 3D applications that meet real-world demands.</p>

    <h3>Your Capstone:</h3>
    <p>The projects in this phase serve as your capstone, allowing you to demonstrate your comprehensive understanding of 3D web development. These projects will be invaluable additions to your portfolio, showcasing your ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-quality interactive experiences.</p>
