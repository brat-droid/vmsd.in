    <p>Once you have your basic Three.js scene set up with a renderer, scene, and camera, the next exciting step is to add your first 3D object. A common starting point is a simple cube, which helps in understanding the core concepts of geometry and materials.</p>
    
    <h3>Geometry: Defining the Shape</h3>
    <p>In Three.js, `Geometry` defines the shape of a 3D object. For a cube, we use `BoxGeometry`, which takes width, height, and depth as arguments.</p>
    <h4>Code Example: Creating BoxGeometry</h4>
    <pre><code>const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1); // 1 unit wide, tall, and deep</code></pre>

    <h3>Material: Defining the Appearance</h3>
    <p>A `Material` defines how the surface of your 3D object looks and reacts to light. For a basic colored cube, `MeshBasicMaterial` or `MeshStandardMaterial` are good choices. `MeshStandardMaterial` reacts to lights, making it more realistic.</p>
    <h4>Code Example: Creating a Material</h4>
    <pre><code>const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 }); // Green color</code></pre>

    <h3>Mesh: Combining Shape and Appearance</h3>
    <p>A `Mesh` is the actual 3D object that gets added to your scene. It combines a `Geometry` and a `Material`.</p>
    <h4>Code Example: Creating a Mesh and Adding to Scene</h4>
    <pre><code>const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);</code></pre>

    <h3>Rendering the Scene</h3>
    <p>Finally, to see your cube, you need to render the scene using your renderer and camera within the animation loop.</p>
    <h4>Code Example: Rendering in the Loop</h4>
    <pre><code>function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();</code></pre>

    <h3>Case Study: A Simple Interactive Logo</h3>
    <p>Imagine creating a simple 3D logo for a website. You could use a `BoxGeometry` for basic shapes, apply your brand colors with `MeshStandardMaterial`, and then add it to your scene. With a few lines of code in the render loop, you could even make the logo slowly rotate, adding a subtle interactive element to your page.</p>
