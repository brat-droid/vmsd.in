    <h2 class="section-title">Your Journey into 3D Web Development Begins Here</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the exciting world of 3D web development! In this first week, we'll lay the foundational knowledge required to start building immersive experiences in your browser. We'll cover the underlying technologies and introduce you to the powerful Three.js library.</p>
    
    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="what-is-webgl.html">What is WebGL?</a> - Understand the low-level API that powers 3D on the web.</li>
      <li><a href="introduction-to-threejs.html">Introduction to Three.js</a> - Get acquainted with the popular JavaScript 3D library.</li>
      <li><a href="creating-a-basic-scene.html">Creating a basic scene (Scene, Camera, Renderer)</a> - Learn the essential components for any 3D environment.</li>
      <li><a href="adding-a-cube-and-rendering.html">Adding a Cube and rendering</a> - Your first 3D object and how to display it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Will Achieve This Week:</h3>
    <p>By the end of this week, you will have a solid understanding of what makes 3D graphics possible in a web browser. You'll be able to set up a basic Three.js project, create a simple 3D object, and render it to the screen. This foundational knowledge is crucial for everything we'll build in the coming weeks.</p>
