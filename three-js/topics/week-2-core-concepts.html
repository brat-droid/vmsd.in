    <h2 class="section-title">Building Blocks: Geometry, Materials, and Lighting</h2>
    <p>In Week 2, we dive deeper into the fundamental elements that bring your 3D scenes to life: geometries (shapes), materials (appearance), and lights. Understanding how these components interact is crucial for creating visually appealing and realistic 3D environments.</p>
    
    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="geometry-and-material-basics.html">Geometry & Material basics (Box, Sphere, Plane)</a> - Explore common 3D shapes and how to define their visual properties.</li>
      <li><a href="mesh-and-object-creation.html">Mesh and object creation</a> - Learn how to combine geometries and materials to form renderable 3D objects.</li>
      <li><a href="lights.html">Lights (Ambient, Directional, Point, Spot)</a> - Discover different types of lights and their impact on your scene.</li>
      <li><a href="shadows-and-lighting-logic.html">Shadows and lighting logic</a> - Understand how to cast and receive shadows for added realism.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Will Achieve This Week:</h3>
    <p>By the end of this week, you will be able to create more complex 3D objects using various geometries and materials. You'll also master the art of lighting your scenes effectively, adding depth and realism through different light types and shadows. This knowledge is essential for crafting compelling visual experiences.</p>
