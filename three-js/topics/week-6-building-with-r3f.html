    <h2 class="section-title">Leveraging React Hooks and Component Structure in 3D</h2>
    <p>Building on the basics of React Three Fiber, Week 6 focuses on utilizing React's powerful features, such as hooks and component nesting, to create more complex and organized 3D scenes. You'll learn how to manage state, handle events, and build reusable 3D components.</p>
    
    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="using-hooks.html">Using hooks: useFrame, useThree, useLoader</a> - Master essential R3F hooks for animation, scene access, and asset loading.</li>
      <li><a href="lights-cameras-and-materials-in-r3f.html">Lights, cameras, and materials in R3F</a> - Configure lighting and camera settings using R3F components.</li>
      <li><a href="nesting-components-to-build-scenes.html">Nesting components to build scenes</a> - Organize your 3D world with a hierarchical component structure.</li>
      <li><a href="reusable-components-and-props.html">Reusable components and props</a> - Create modular and flexible 3D components for efficient development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Will Achieve This Week:</h3>
    <p>By the end of this week, you will be comfortable building more sophisticated 3D scenes in R3F by effectively using React hooks and structuring your components. You'll be able to manage complex 3D environments with greater ease and create more maintainable and scalable 3D applications.</p>
