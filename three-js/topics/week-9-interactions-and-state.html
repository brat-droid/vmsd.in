    <h2 class="section-title">Making Your 3D Scenes Responsive and Dynamic</h2>
    <p>Interactivity is key to engaging 3D web experiences. In Week 9, you'll learn how to enable user interactions with your 3D objects and manage the state of your scene effectively. This includes handling clicks, hovers, drags, and integrating robust state management solutions.</p>
    
    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="hover-click-drag-selection-logic.html">Hover, click, drag, selection logic</a> - Implement common user interaction patterns for 3D objects.</li>
      <li><a href="raycasting-in-r3f.html">Raycasting in R3F</a> - Understand how to detect intersections between the mouse cursor and 3D objects.</li>
      <li><a href="state-management-in-3d.html">State management in 3D (Zustand or Redux)</a> - Learn to manage complex application state in a 3D environment.</li>
      <li><a href="camera-transitions.html">Camera transitions</a> - Create smooth and cinematic camera movements between different views.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Will Achieve This Week:</h3>
    <p>By the end of this week, you will be able to create highly interactive 3D scenes where users can directly manipulate objects and navigate the environment. You'll also gain proficiency in managing the state of your 3D applications, ensuring a robust and responsive user experience.</p>
