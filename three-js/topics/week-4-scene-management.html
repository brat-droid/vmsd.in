    <h2 class="section-title">Organizing Your 3D World and Enhancing Visuals</h2>
    <p>As your 3D scenes grow in complexity, effective scene management becomes paramount. In Week 4, you'll learn how to organize your objects, enhance the visual environment with atmospheric effects, and incorporate external 3D models and textures to enrich your scenes.</p>
    
    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="grouping-objects.html">Grouping objects</a> - Learn to manage multiple 3D objects efficiently.</li>
      <li><a href="fog-background-and-environment-maps.html">Fog, background, and environment maps</a> - Add atmospheric depth and realistic reflections to your scenes.</li>
      <li><a href="texture-loading-and-mapping.html">Texture loading and mapping (diffuse, bump, normal)</a> - Apply detailed images to your 3D objects for enhanced realism.</li>
      <li><a href="model-loading.html">Model loading (GLTFLoader, OBJLoader)</a> - Import complex 3D models created in external software.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What You Will Achieve This Week:</h3>
    <p>By the end of this week, you'll be proficient in structuring your 3D scenes, creating more immersive environments with advanced visual effects, and integrating external 3D assets. This will enable you to build richer and more detailed 3D web experiences.</p>
