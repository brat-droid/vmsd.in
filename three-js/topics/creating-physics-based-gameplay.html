    <h1>Creating Physics-Based Gameplay in Three.js</h1>
    <p>Three.js is a powerful 3D rendering library, but it does not include a built-in physics engine. To create realistic physics-based gameplay, where objects interact with forces like gravity, collisions, and friction, you need to integrate a separate JavaScript physics library.</p>

    <h2>Popular Physics Libraries for Three.js:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cannon.js:</b> A lightweight and easy-to-use pure JavaScript physics engine. It's good for simpler physics simulations and is often a good starting point for web-based physics.</li>
        <li><b>Ammo.js:</b> A direct WebAssembly port of the powerful Bullet physics engine (written in C++). It's more robust and feature-rich, suitable for complex and high-performance physics simulations.</li>
        <li><b>Rapier:</b> A newer, high-performance 2D and 3D physics engine written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. It's gaining popularity for its speed and modern design.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>General Steps for Integrating a Physics Engine:</h2>
    <p>The process of integrating a physics engine with Three.js generally follows these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Initialize the Physics World:</b> Create an instance of the physics world provided by your chosen library (e.g., <code>new CANNON.World()</code> for Cannon.js or <code>new Ammo.btDiscreteDynamicsWorld()</code> for Ammo.js). This world will manage all the physics calculations.</li>
        <li><b>Create Physics Bodies:</b> For each object in your Three.js scene that needs to participate in physics (e.g., a character, a ball, a static wall), create a corresponding physics body. These bodies have properties like mass, shape (box, sphere, cylinder), and friction.</li>
        <li><b>Link Three.js Meshes to Physics Bodies:</b> Your Three.js meshes are for rendering, while the physics bodies are for simulation. You need to establish a connection so that the visual representation (Three.js mesh) follows the physical simulation (physics body). This means positioning and orienting your Three.js meshes based on the position and orientation of their corresponding physics bodies.</li>
        <li><b>Update the Physics World:</b> In your animation loop, you must step the physics world forward by a small, fixed time increment (e.g., <code>physicsWorld.step(deltaTime)</code>). This calculates the new positions and rotations of all physics bodies based on forces, collisions, and other physical properties.</li>
        <li><b>Update Three.js Meshes:</b> After the physics world updates, you retrieve the new positions and rotations from the physics bodies and apply them to their respective Three.js meshes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conceptual Example: Physics Integration Loop</h2>
    <p>This is a conceptual example of the animation loop when integrating a physics engine. A full working example would require including and setting up a specific physics library.</p>

    <pre><code>import * as THREE from 'three';
// import * as CANNON from 'cannon-es'; // Example for Cannon.js

// Assume scene, camera, renderer are set up
// Assume physicsWorld is initialized
// Assume threeJsMesh and physicsBody are created and linked

const clock = new THREE.Clock();

function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);

    const deltaTime = clock.getDelta();

    // Step the physics world
    // physicsWorld.step(1 / 60, deltaTime); // Fixed time step, variable delta

    // Update Three.js mesh position and rotation from physics body
    // threeJsMesh.position.copy(physicsBody.position);
    // threeJsMesh.quaternion.copy(physicsBody.quaternion);

    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
