    <h2 class="section-title">Assess the Performance of Your Machine Learning Models</h2>
    <p>Model evaluation is the process of assessing the performance of your machine learning models. In this section, we will learn about the different metrics that are used to evaluate machine learning models.</p>
    
    <h3>Classification Metrics</h3>
    <p>Classification metrics are used to evaluate the performance of classification models. The most common classification metrics are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Accuracy:</b> The percentage of correctly classified instances.</li>
        <li><b>Precision:</b> The percentage of positive predictions that are correct.</li>
        <li><b>Recall:</b> The percentage of positive instances that are correctly classified.</li>
        <li><b>F1-score:</b> The harmonic mean of precision and recall.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Regression Metrics</h3>
    <p>Regression metrics are used to evaluate the performance of regression models. The most common regression metrics are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mean squared error (MSE):</b> The average of the squared errors.</li>
        <li><b>Root mean squared error (RMSE):</b> The square root of the MSE.</li>
        <li><b>R-squared:</b> A measure of how well the model fits the data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Study: Evaluating a Customer Churn Prediction Model</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will evaluate a customer churn prediction model. We will use the metrics we have learned to assess the performance of the model and to identify areas for improvement. We will also discuss the importance of choosing the right evaluation metric for your project.</p>
