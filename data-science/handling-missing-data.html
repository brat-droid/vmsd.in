    <p>Missing data is a common problem in data science. It can occur for a variety of reasons, such as errors in data entry, equipment malfunctions, or a lack of response from survey participants. In this section, we will learn how to identify and handle missing data in a Pandas DataFrame.</p>
    
    <h3>Identifying Missing Data</h3>
    <p>The first step in handling missing data is to identify it. We will show you how to use the `isnull()` and `sum()` methods in Pandas to identify the number of missing values in each column of a DataFrame. We will also discuss how to visualize missing data using libraries like `missingno`.</p>

    <h3>Handling Missing Data</h3>
    <p>There are two main ways to handle missing data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Dropping missing values:</b> You can drop rows or columns that contain missing values. This is a simple approach, but it can lead to a loss of data.</li>
      <li><b>Imputing missing values:</b> You can fill in missing values with a value, such as the mean, median, or mode of the column. This is a more sophisticated approach, but it can also introduce bias into your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advanced Imputation Techniques</h3>
    <p>We will also discuss some more advanced imputation techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation and multiple imputation.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Cleaning a Customer Dataset</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will clean a customer dataset that contains missing values. We will use the techniques we have learned to identify and handle the missing data. We will compare the performance of different imputation techniques and choose the one that is best for our dataset. Finally, we will use the cleaned dataset to build a machine learning model.</p>
