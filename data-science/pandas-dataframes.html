    <h2 class="section-title">The Ultimate Tool for Data Manipulation and Analysis</h2>
    <p>The Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It is the most popular tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python. In this section, we will take a deep dive into the world of Pandas DataFrames and learn how to use them to their full potential.</p>
    
    <h3>Creating DataFrames</h3>
    <p>You can create a DataFrame from a variety of sources, such as a CSV file, an Excel file, a JSON file, or a SQL database. We will show you how to create a DataFrame from each of these sources and how to customize the import process.</p>

    <h3>Manipulating DataFrames</h3>
    <p>Once you have created a DataFrame, you can manipulate it in a variety of ways. We will cover the most common DataFrame manipulation tasks, such as selecting columns, filtering rows, grouping data, and merging DataFrames.</p>

    <h3>Advanced Topics</h3>
    <p>We will also cover some more advanced topics, such as working with time series data, handling missing data, and creating pivot tables.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Analyzing Sales Data</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will use a Pandas DataFrame to analyze sales data. We will load the data from a CSV file, clean it, and then perform a variety of data manipulation and analysis tasks. We will calculate summary statistics, create visualizations, and build a simple predictive model.</p>
