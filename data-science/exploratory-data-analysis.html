    <h2 class="section-title">Get to Know Your Data Before You Start Modeling</h2>
    <p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of exploring your data to get to know it better. This is an important step in any data science project, as it can help you to identify patterns and relationships in your data that you may not have been aware of. In this section, we will learn about the different EDA techniques and how to apply them to your data.</p>
    
    <h3>Common EDA Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Summary statistics:</b> Calculating summary statistics, such as the mean, median, and mode, can help you to get a better understanding of your data.</li>
      <li><b>Data visualization:</b> Visualizing your data can help you to identify patterns and relationships that you may not be able to see in the raw data.</li>
      <li><b>Data cleaning:</b> Cleaning your data can help you to remove errors and inconsistencies that could affect your analysis.</li>
      <li><b>Feature engineering:</b> Creating new features from your existing data can help you to improve the performance of your machine learning models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Study: The Phenomenon of iPhone Adoption</h3>
    <p>The iPhone's launch and subsequent global adoption represent a fascinating case study for exploratory data analysis. By analyzing sales data, user demographics, app usage, and market trends, data scientists could uncover the driving forces behind its rapid success and evolving user behavior.</p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=iPhone+Adoption+Graph" alt="iPhone Adoption Graph Placeholder" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 20px auto; border-radius: 8px;">
    <p>EDA on iPhone adoption data might involve:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Time-Series Analysis:</b> Plotting sales figures over time to identify growth phases, saturation points, and seasonal trends.</li>
        <li><b>Geographical Distribution:</b> Mapping adoption rates across different countries or regions to understand market penetration.</li>
        <li><b>User Segmentation:</b> Analyzing demographic data to identify core user groups and their characteristics.</li>
        <li><b>App Usage Patterns:</b> Exploring which apps are most popular and how usage changes over different iPhone models or iOS versions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Such analysis would provide invaluable insights into consumer electronics market dynamics and product lifecycle management.</p>
