    <p>Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, transforming, and enriching your data to get it ready for analysis. This is an important step in any data science project, as it can help to improve the quality of your data and the accuracy of your results. In this section, we will learn about the different data wrangling techniques and how to apply them to your data.</p>
    
    <h3>Common Data Wrangling Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Data cleaning:</b> Removing errors and inconsistencies from your data.</li>
      <li><b>Data transformation:</b> Changing the format of your data to make it more suitable for analysis.</li>
      <li><b>Data enrichment:</b> Adding new data to your dataset to make it more complete.</li>
      <li><b>Data validation:</b> Checking your data for accuracy and completeness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Study: Wrangling a Dataset of Website Traffic Data</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will wrangle a dataset of website traffic data. We will use the techniques we have learned to clean, transform, and enrich the data. We will then use the wrangled data to build a machine learning model to predict website traffic. We will also discuss the importance of data wrangling for building accurate and reliable machine learning models.</p>
