    <h2 class="section-title">The Ultimate Tool for Interactive Data Science</h2>
    <p>Jupyter Notebooks are an essential tool for any data scientist. They provide an interactive, web-based environment that allows you to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document. This makes them ideal for a wide range of data science tasks, from data exploration and analysis to machine learning and presentation.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <p>Jupyter Notebooks have a number of features that make them well-suited for data science:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Interactive Cells:</b> You can run code in small, manageable chunks, which makes it easy to experiment and debug your code.</li>
      <li><b>Markdown Support:</b> You can use Markdown to add rich text, images, and links to your notebooks, which makes them a great tool for creating reports and presentations.</li>
      <li><b>Magic Commands:</b> You can use magic commands to extend the functionality of your notebooks. For example, you can use the `%matplotlib inline` magic command to display Matplotlib plots directly in your notebook.</li>
      <li><b>Sharing and Collaboration:</b> You can easily share your notebooks with others, and you can use tools like Google Colab to collaborate on notebooks in real time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Study: Creating a Data Exploration Report</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will use a Jupyter Notebook to create a comprehensive data exploration report. We will start by loading a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Then, we will use a combination of code, text, and visualizations to explore the data and uncover insights. We will use Markdown to structure our report and to provide explanations of our findings. Finally, we will use Matplotlib to create a variety of plots to visualize our data.</p>
