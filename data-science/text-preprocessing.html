    <h2 class="section-title">Prepare Your Text Data for Analysis</h2>
    <p>Text preprocessing is the process of cleaning and preparing your text data for analysis. This is an important step in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as it can help to improve the performance of the NLP model. In this section, we will learn about the different text preprocessing techniques and how to apply them to your data.</p>
    
    <h3>Common Text Preprocessing Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Tokenization:</b> Splitting text into individual words or tokens.</li>
      <li><b>Stop word removal:</b> Removing common words that do not add much meaning to the text.</li>
      <li><b>Stemming and lemmatization:</b> Reducing words to their root form.</li>
      <li><b>Part-of-speech tagging:</b> Identifying the part of speech of each word in a sentence.</li>
      <li><b>Named entity recognition:</b> Identifying named entities, such as people, places, and organizations, in a sentence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Study: Preprocessing a Dataset of Customer Reviews</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will preprocess a dataset of customer reviews. We will use the techniques we have learned to clean and prepare the text data. We will then use the preprocessed data to build a sentiment analysis model. We will also discuss the importance of text preprocessing for sentiment analysis.</p>
