    <h2 class="section-title">Manage Your Data with the Power of SQL</h2>
    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. In this section, we will learn how to use SQL to manage your data in a relational database.</p>
    
    <h3>Creating Tables</h3>
    <p>The first step in managing your data with SQL is to create tables to store your data. We will show you how to use the `CREATE TABLE` statement to create a new table. We will also discuss how to choose the right data types for your columns and how to define primary and foreign keys.</p>

    <h3>Inserting Data</h3>
    <p>Once you have created a table, you can insert data into it using the `INSERT INTO` statement. We will show you how to insert single rows and multiple rows of data. We will also discuss how to handle errors that may occur during the insertion process.</p>

    <h3>Querying Data</h3>
    <p>You can query your data using the `SELECT` statement. The `SELECT` statement allows you to select specific columns and rows from a table. We will show you how to use the `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` clauses to filter, sort, and group your data.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Creating a Customer Database</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will create a customer database and use SQL to insert and query data. We will also show you how to use the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements to modify your data. Finally, we will discuss how to use joins to combine data from multiple tables.</p>
