    <h2 class="section-title">Build Models to Understand and Predict Your Data</h2>
    <p>Statistical modelling is the process of building mathematical models to understand and predict your data. In this section, we will learn about the different types of statistical models and how to choose the right one for your project.</p>
    
    <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
    <p>Linear regression is a statistical model that is used to predict a continuous variable from one or more independent variables. It is a simple and powerful model that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as predicting sales, prices, and stock prices.</p>

    <h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
    <p>Logistic regression is a statistical model that is used to predict a binary variable from one or more independent variables. It is a popular model for classification tasks, such as predicting whether a customer will churn or whether a loan will be approved.</p>

    <h3>Decision Trees</h3>
    <p>Decision trees are a type of statistical model that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. They are a simple and interpretable model that can be used to understand the relationships between your variables.</p>

    <h3>Model Selection</h3>
    <p>Choosing the right model is an important step in any data science project. We will discuss the different factors to consider when choosing a model, such as the type of data you have, the problem you are trying to solve, and the interpretability of the model.</p>
