    <h2 class="section-title">Bring Your Data to a Common Scale</h2>
    <p>Data normalization is the process of scaling your data to a common range. This is an important step in many machine learning algorithms, as it can help to improve the performance of the algorithm. In this section, we will learn about the different types of data normalization and how to choose the right one for your project.</p>
    
    <h3>Min-Max Scaling</h3>
    <p>Min-max scaling is a simple and common method of data normalization. It scales the data to a range of 0 to 1. This is a good choice for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the data, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines.</p>

    <h3>Standardization</h3>
    <p>Standardization is another common method of data normalization. It scales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is a good choice for algorithms that assume that the data is normally distributed, such as linear regression and logistic regression.</p>

    <h3>Robust Scaling</h3>
    <p>Robust scaling is a method of data normalization that is robust to outliers. It scales the data to a range of -1 to 1, but it uses the interquartile range instead of the min and max values. This makes it a good choice for datasets that contain outliers.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Normalizing a Dataset for a K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will normalize a dataset for a k-nearest neighbors algorithm. We will use both min-max scaling and standardization and compare the performance of the algorithm with and without normalization. We will also discuss the importance of normalizing your data before using a k-nearest neighbors algorithm.</p>
