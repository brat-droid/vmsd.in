    <h2 class="section-title">Access a World of Data Through APIs</h2>
    <p>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a powerful way to access data from a wide variety of sources. In this section, we will learn how to use the `requests` library in Python to make API requests and retrieve data in JSON format.</p>
    
    <h3>Making API Requests</h3>
    <p>We will show you how to make GET requests to retrieve data from an API. We will also discuss how to handle authentication and how to pass parameters to the API.</p>

    <h3>Working with JSON Data</h3>
    <p>Once you have retrieved data from an API, you will need to parse the JSON response. We will show you how to use the `json` library in Python to parse JSON data and to extract the information you need.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Getting Real-Time Stock Prices from a Financial API</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will use a financial API to get real-time stock prices for a list of companies. We will start by signing up for an API key. Then, we will use the `requests` library to make a GET request to the API and retrieve the stock prices in JSON format. Finally, we will parse the JSON response and store the data in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.</p>
