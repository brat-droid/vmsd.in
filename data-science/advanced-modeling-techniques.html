    <h2 class="section-title">Take Your Machine Learning Models to the Next Level</h2>
    <p>In this section, we will learn about advanced modeling techniques that you can use to improve the performance of your machine learning models.</p>
    
    <h3>Ensemble Methods</h3>
    <p>Ensemble methods are a type of machine learning that combines multiple models to improve the overall performance. The two most common ensemble methods are bagging and boosting. We will discuss how these methods work and how to apply them to your data.</p>

    <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
    <p>Deep learning is a type of machine learning that is inspired by the structure of the human brain. Deep learning models are able to learn complex patterns in data and can be used for a variety of tasks, such as image recognition and natural language processing. We will provide an overview of deep learning and discuss some of the most popular deep learning architectures.</p>

    <h3>Transfer Learning</h3>
    <p>Transfer learning is a technique that allows you to use a pre-trained model as a starting point for your own model. This can be a great way to improve the performance of your model, especially if you have a small dataset. We will discuss how to use transfer learning and provide some examples of how it can be used.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Building a Deep Learning Model for Image Recognition</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will build a deep learning model for image recognition. We will use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. We will also discuss how to use transfer learning to improve the performance of our model.</p>
