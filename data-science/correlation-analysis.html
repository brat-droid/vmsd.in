    <h2 class="section-title">Discover the Relationships Between Your Variables</h2>
    <p>Correlation analysis is a statistical method that is used to discover the relationships between two or more variables. In this section, we will learn how to calculate and interpret correlation coefficients.</p>
    
    <h3>Pearson Correlation Coefficient</h3>
    <p>The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.</p>

    <h3>Spearman Correlation Coefficient</h3>
    <p>The Spearman correlation coefficient is a measure of the monotonic relationship between two variables. It is a non-parametric measure of correlation, which means that it does not assume that the data is normally distributed.</p>

    <h3>Correlation vs. Causation</h3>
    <p>It is important to remember that correlation does not imply causation. Just because two variables are correlated does not mean that one variable causes the other. There may be a third variable that is causing both variables to change.</p>
