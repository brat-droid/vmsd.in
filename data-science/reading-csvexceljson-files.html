    <h2 class="section-title">Load Data from Common File Formats</h2>
    <p>Data is often stored in a variety of file formats. In this section, we will learn how to use the Pandas library to read data from the most common file formats, such as CSV, Excel, and JSON.</p>
    
    <h3>Reading CSV Files</h3>
    <p>CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple and widely used format for storing tabular data. We will show you how to use the `read_csv()` function in Pandas to load a CSV file into a DataFrame. We will also discuss how to handle common issues, such as headers, delimiters, and encoding.</p>

    <h3>Reading Excel Files</h3>
    <p>Excel is a popular spreadsheet application that is often used to store data. We will show you how to use the `read_excel()` function in Pandas to load an Excel file into a DataFrame. We will also discuss how to handle multiple sheets and how to specify the data types of the columns.</p>

    <h3>Reading JSON Files</h3>
    <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is often used for web APIs. We will show you how to use the `read_json()` function in Pandas to load a JSON file into a DataFrame. We will also discuss how to handle nested JSON and how to normalize the data into a flat table.</p>
