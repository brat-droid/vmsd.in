    <p>Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used to make inferences about your data. In this section, we will learn how to formulate and test hypotheses.</p>
    
    <h3>Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h3>
    <p>The first step in hypothesis testing is to formulate a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no effect, while the alternative hypothesis is a statement that there is an effect.</p>

    <h3>P-values</h3>
    <p>The p-value is the probability of obtaining a result as extreme as the one that was observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value indicates that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true.</p>

    <h3>Type I and Type II Errors</h3>
    <p>There are two types of errors that you can make in hypothesis testing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Type I error:</b> Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.</li>
        <li><b>Type II error:</b> Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Study: Testing the Effectiveness of a New Drug</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will test the effectiveness of a new drug. We will formulate a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, and then we will use a p-value to determine whether the new drug is effective. We will also discuss the importance of controlling for Type I and Type II errors.</p>
