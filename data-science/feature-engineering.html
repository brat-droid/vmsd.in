    <h2 class="section-title">Create New Features to Improve Your Machine Learning Models</h2>
    <p>Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from your existing data to improve the performance of your machine learning models. This is an important step in any machine learning project, as it can help to improve the accuracy of your models and make them more interpretable. In this section, we will learn about the different feature engineering techniques and how to apply them to your data.</p>
    
    <h3>Common Feature Engineering Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>One-hot encoding:</b> Converting categorical variables into numerical variables.</li>
      <li><b>Binning:</b> Converting continuous variables into categorical variables.</li>
      <li><b>Polynomial features:</b> Creating new features by raising existing features to a power.</li>
      <li><b>Interaction features:</b> Creating new features by multiplying two or more existing features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Study: Engineering Features for a Housing Price Prediction Model</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will engineer features for a housing price prediction model. We will use the techniques we have learned to create new features from the existing data. We will then use the engineered features to build a more accurate and interpretable model. We will also discuss the importance of feature engineering for building high-performing machine learning models.</p>
