    <p>Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It is a powerful technique that can be used to collect data for a variety of purposes, such as market research, price comparison, and lead generation. In this section, we will learn how to use the BeautifulSoup library in Python to scrape data from websites.</p>
    
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>BeautifulSoup is a Python library that makes it easy to parse HTML and XML documents. It takes the raw HTML from a website and turns it into a Python object that you can easily navigate and search. This allows you to extract the specific data you need, such as text, links, and images.</p>

    <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
    <p>It is important to be aware of the ethical considerations of web scraping. You should always check the website's terms of service to see if they allow scraping. You should also be careful not to overload the website's servers with too many requests.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Scraping Product Prices from an E-commerce Website</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will use BeautifulSoup to scrape the prices of products from an e-commerce website. We will start by sending a request to the website and getting the HTML content of the page. Then, we will use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the product names and prices. Finally, we will store the data in a CSV file for further analysis.</p>
