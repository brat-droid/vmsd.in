    <h2 class="section-title">Explore the World of Non-Relational Databases</h2>
    <p>NoSQL databases are a type of database that does not use the traditional relational database model. NoSQL databases are often used for big data and real-time web applications. In this section, we will explore the different types of NoSQL databases and learn how to choose the right one for your project.</p>
    
    <h3>Types of NoSQL Databases</h3>
    <p>There are four main types of NoSQL databases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Document databases:</b> Store data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects. Examples include MongoDB and Couchbase.</li>
      <li><b>Key-value stores:</b> Store data as key-value pairs. Examples include Redis and DynamoDB.</li>
      <li><b>Column-family stores:</b> Store data in columns rather than rows. Examples include Cassandra and HBase.</li>
      <li><b>Graph databases:</b> Store data in a graph structure. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When to Use a NoSQL Database</h3>
    <p>NoSQL databases are a good choice for applications that require high scalability, availability, and performance. They are also a good choice for applications that need to store unstructured or semi-structured data.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Using a Document Database to Store Product Catalog Data</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will use a document database to store product catalog data. We will show you how to create a document for each product and how to query the data to find products that match specific criteria. We will also discuss the advantages of using a document database for this type of application.</p>
