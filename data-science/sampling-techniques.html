    <h2 class="section-title">Select a Representative Subset of Your Data</h2>
    <p>Sampling is the process of selecting a representative subset of your data. This is an important step in many data science projects, as it can help you to save time and money by reducing the amount of data that you need to collect and analyze. In this section, we will learn about the different sampling techniques and how to choose the right one for your project.</p>
    
    <h3>Simple Random Sampling</h3>
    <p>Simple random sampling is a sampling technique in which each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This is the simplest sampling technique, but it may not be the most efficient.</p>

    <h3>Stratified Sampling</h3>
    <p>Stratified sampling is a sampling technique in which the population is divided into subgroups, or strata, and then a random sample is selected from each stratum. This is a more efficient sampling technique than simple random sampling, as it ensures that each subgroup is represented in the sample.</p>

    <h3>Cluster Sampling</h3>
    <p>Cluster sampling is a sampling technique in which the population is divided into clusters, and then a random sample of clusters is selected. All of the members of the selected clusters are then included in the sample. This is a less efficient sampling technique than stratified sampling, but it is often more practical.</p>
