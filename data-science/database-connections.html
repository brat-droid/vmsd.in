    <h2 class="section-title">Connect to and Query Databases with Python</h2>
    <p>Databases are a powerful tool for storing and managing large datasets. In this section, we will learn how to connect to a SQL database from Python and execute queries to retrieve data.</p>
    
    <h3>Connecting to a Database</h3>
    <p>We will show you how to use the `sqlite3` library in Python to connect to a SQLite database. We will also discuss how to connect to other types of databases, such as PostgreSQL and MySQL, using libraries like `psycopg2` and `mysql-connector-python`.</p>

    <h3>Executing Queries</h3>
    <p>Once you are connected to a database, you can execute SQL queries to retrieve data. We will show you how to use the `execute()` method to run queries and the `fetchall()` method to retrieve the results. We will also discuss how to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Querying a Customer Database</h3>
    <p>In this case study, we will connect to a customer database and execute a query to retrieve a list of all customers who have made a purchase in the last month. We will then store the results in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis. We will also show you how to use the `to_sql()` function in Pandas to write a DataFrame to a SQL database.</p>
