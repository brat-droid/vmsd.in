    <p>The first step in any data science project is to define a clear and concise problem statement. This will help you to focus your efforts and to ensure that you are solving the right problem. In this section, we will learn how to write a problem statement that is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).</p>
    
    <h3>What is a Problem Statement?</h3>
    <p>A problem statement is a clear and concise description of the problem that you are trying to solve. It should be specific enough to be actionable, but general enough to allow for creative solutions. A good problem statement will also include a goal that you want to achieve.</p>
