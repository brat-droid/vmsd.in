            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li><strong>Planning and Scheduling:</strong> Create detailed project schedules, define tasks, set dependencies, and identify the critical path.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Assign resources (people, equipment, materials) to tasks, track their availability, and identify over-allocations.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Management:</strong> Estimate project costs, track actual spending, and analyze cost variances.</li>
                <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Monitor project progress, update task completion, and compare actual performance to the baseline.</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting and Analysis:</strong> Generate various reports to communicate project status to stakeholders and to identify areas for improvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Features of Microsoft Project</h2>
            <p>Let's delve deeper into some of the core functionalities that make MS Project an indispensable tool for project managers.</p>
            
            <div class="accordion">
                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">1. Gantt Charts</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>At the heart of MS Project is the Gantt chart. It provides a visual representation of your project schedule, showing tasks, their durations, and dependencies. You can easily create and modify tasks, link them together, and see the impact of changes on your overall schedule. MS Project automatically calculates the critical path, helping you to identify the tasks that are most crucial to your project's completion date.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">2. Resource Management</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>MS Project allows you to define and assign resources to tasks. You can track resource availability, identify over-allocations, and use features like resource leveling to smooth out workloads. This helps you to ensure that your team is not overloaded and that you have the right resources available when you need them.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">3. Cost Tracking and Budgeting</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>You can enter cost information for tasks and resources in MS Project. The software then aggregates these costs to provide a total project cost. You can track actual spending against your budget, analyze cost variances, and forecast your project's final cost. This helps you to keep your project within budget and to make informed financial decisions.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                 <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">4. Baselines</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>A baseline is a snapshot of your project plan at a specific point in time. It includes your planned schedule, costs, and scope. MS Project allows you to save multiple baselines, which is crucial for tracking changes and for measuring your project's performance against its original plan. Without a baseline, it's impossible to know if you are on track or if your project is drifting.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>MS Project offers a wide range of built-in reports and customizable dashboards. These reports can help you to communicate project status to stakeholders, to identify potential problems, and to make data-driven decisions.

                <li><strong>Regularly update progress:</strong> To get an accurate picture of your project's status, you need to regularly update the progress of your tasks in MS Project.</li>
                <li><strong>Use baselines:</strong> Always save a baseline at the beginning of your project. This will allow you to track changes and to measure your performance against your original plan.</li>
