        </header>
        <article class="article-content">
            <p class="intro">While the Agile Manifesto provides the values and principles, Scrum provides the framework. Scrum is a lightweight yet powerful framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is the most popular Agile framework in use today, and for good reason. Scrum is designed to help teams to deliver value to their customers in small increments, to adapt to changing requirements, and to continuously improve their processes. This article will provide a comprehensive overview of the Scrum framework, including its roles, events, and artifacts.</p>

            <h2>The Three Pillars of Scrum</h2>
            <p>Scrum is founded on the principles of empiricism, which asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control:</p>
            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptation:</strong> If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Scrum Team: Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>The Scrum Team is a small, cross-functional team of people who are responsible for delivering a potentially releasable increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. The Scrum Team consists of three roles:</p>
            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li><strong>The Product Owner:</strong> The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team. The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.</li>
                <li><strong>The Development Team:</strong> The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work.</li>
                <li><strong>The Scrum Master:</strong> The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Scrum Events: A Rhythm for the Team</h2>
            <p>Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, all of which are contained within the Sprint, which is a time-box of one month or less.</p>
            
            <div class="accordion">
                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">1. The Sprint</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>The heart of Scrum is the Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">2. Sprint Planning</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">3. Daily Scrum</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                 <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">4. Sprint Review</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                 <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">5. Sprint Retrospective</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. This is a three-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>The Scrum Artifacts: Transparency and Value</h2>
            <p>Scrum's artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everyone has the same understanding of the artifact.</p>
            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li><strong>Product Backlog:</strong> The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.</li>
                <li><strong>Sprint Backlog:</strong> The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a "Done" Increment.</li>
                <li><strong>Increment:</strong> The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done," which means it must be in a useable condition and meet the Scrum Team's definition of "Done".</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Scrum is a simple framework, but it is difficult to master. It is not a prescriptive methodology. It provides a set of rules and guidelines, but it is up to the team to figure out how to best apply them in their specific context. The power of Scrum lies in its focus on empiricism, its emphasis on teamwork and collaboration, and its ability to help teams to deliver value in a complex and uncertain world. By embracing the principles and practices of Scrum, you can help your team to become more agile, more productive, and more successful.</p>
