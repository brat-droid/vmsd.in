            <h1>Agile Manifesto</h1>
        </header>
        <article class="article-content">
            <p class="intro">In the late 1990s, the software development industry was in a state of crisis. Projects were consistently late, over budget, and failing to meet customer expectations. The traditional, heavyweight project management methodologies, like the Waterfall model, were simply not working for the fast-paced, ever-changing world of software development. In response to this crisis, a group of 17 software developers met in Snowbird, Utah in February 2001. They came from different backgrounds and had different ideas, but they shared a common frustration with the status quo. Over the course of two days, they created a document that would change the face of software development forever: the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.</p>

                <h3>Interactive Manifesto Sorter</h3>
                <p>The Agile Manifesto is made up of four core values. Drag the values to match them with their corresponding principles.</p>

            <h2>The Four Core Values of the Agile Manifesto</h2>
            <p>The Agile Manifesto is not a methodology or a framework. It is a statement of values and principles. It is a call for a new way of thinking about software development. The manifesto is comprised of four core values:</p>
            <ol class="custom-list">
                <li><strong>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:</strong> Agile recognizes that people are the most important factor in software development. While processes and tools are important, it is the communication and collaboration between individuals that ultimately determines the success of a project.</li>
                <li><strong>Working software over comprehensive documentation:</strong> The primary measure of progress in an Agile project is working software. While documentation has its place, it should not be created for its own sake. The focus should be on delivering a product that works, not on producing reams of documentation that may never be read.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:</strong> Agile emphasizes a close, collaborative relationship with the customer. The customer is not seen as an adversary to be managed through a contract, but as a partner in the development process. This close collaboration ensures that the final product meets the customer's needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Responding to change over following a plan:</strong> In a traditional project, change is seen as a bad thing that should be avoided. In an Agile project, change is embraced as a reality of software development. Agile teams are expected to be able to respond to changing requirements and to adapt their plans accordingly.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It's important to note that the manifesto is not saying that the items on the right have no value. It is simply saying that the items on the left are valued more.</p>

            <h2>The 12 Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto</h2>
            <p>In addition to the four core values, the authors of the Agile Manifesto also created a set of 12 supporting principles. These principles provide more detailed guidance on how to apply the Agile values in practice.</p>

            <h2>The Impact of the Agile Manifesto</h2>
            <p>The Agile Manifesto has had a profound impact on the software development industry and beyond. It has inspired a number of specific methodologies, such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), that have been adopted by companies all over the world. The principles of Agile have also been applied to other industries, such as manufacturing, marketing, and even education. The manifesto's focus on collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement has resonated with people in a wide variety of fields.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The Agile Manifesto is more than just a document. It is a philosophy and a movement. It is a rejection of the rigid, command-and-control style of management that dominated the 20th century and an embrace of a more humanistic, collaborative, and adaptive approach to work. By understanding and embracing the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto, you can help your teams to work more effectively, to deliver more value to your customers, and to thrive in the fast-paced, ever-changing world of the 21st century.</p>
