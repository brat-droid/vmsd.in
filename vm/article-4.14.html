                <li><b>Installation and Dismantle Dates:</b> Precise dates for when each display will be installed and removed. This is crucial for logistics and scheduling.</li>

            </ul>

                <li><b>Operational Efficiency:</b> Streamlines the process of planning, sourcing, and installing displays, reducing last-minute rushes and errors.</li>
                <li><b>Cost Control:</b> Enables better budget forecasting and resource allocation, potentially leading to cost savings through bulk purchasing or repurposing.</li>

                <li><b>Start Early:</b> Begin planning major campaigns months in advance to allow ample time for concept development, sourcing, and fabrication.</li>
                <li><b>Collaborate:</b> Involve marketing, buying, and sales teams in the planning process to ensure alignment and leverage their insights.</li>
                <li><b>Be Flexible:</b> While a plan is essential, be prepared to adapt to unexpected changes in product availability, market trends, or external events.</li>
                <li><b>Document and Review:</b> Keep detailed records of past displays, including photos, costs, and sales data. Use this information to evaluate effectiveness and inform future planning.</li>
                <li><b>Consider Store Specifics:</b> For multi-location retailers, the calendar might need slight variations to account for regional differences in climate, holidays, or local events.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A well-structured window calendar is a dynamic tool that empowers visual merchandisers to create a continuous stream of fresh, engaging, and commercially effective window displays, keeping the brand relevant and exciting for customers throughout the year.</p>
