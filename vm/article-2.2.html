                <li><b>Portfolio Development:</b> Building a strong, diverse portfolio is essential for showcasing one's abilities. This should include high-quality photographs of executed displays, sketches, digital mock-ups, planograms, and conceptual designs, demonstrating both creativity and technical proficiency.</li>
            </ul>
