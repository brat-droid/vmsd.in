            <p>Media planning is the process of selecting the optimal combination of media channels (e.g., TV, radio, print, digital, social media) to deliver an advertising message to the target audience at the most effective time and place.</p>
            <p>The goal of media planning is to maximize the impact of an advertising campaign while minimizing costs.</p>
            <h2>Key Steps in Media Planning:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target Audience Analysis:</strong> Understanding the demographics, psychographics, and media consumption habits of your target audience.</li>
                <li><strong>Setting Media Objectives:</strong> What do you want the media plan to achieve? (e.g., reach a certain percentage of the target audience, generate a specific number of impressions).</li>
                <li><strong>Media Mix Selection:</strong> Deciding which combination of traditional and digital media channels will be most effective.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Scheduling:</strong> Determining when and how often ads will run (e.g., continuous, flighting, pulsing).</li>
                <li><strong>Budget Allocation:</strong> Distributing the advertising budget across different media channels and time periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Measurement & Evaluation:</strong> Tracking the performance of the media plan against objectives and making adjustments as needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Effective media planning ensures that your advertising message reaches the right people, at the right time, through the right channels.</p>
