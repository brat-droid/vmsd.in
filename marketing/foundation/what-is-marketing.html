            <p>Marketing is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of a target market in terms of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; and other public exposures.</p>
            <p>At its core, marketing is about understanding your customers so well that you can create products or services that perfectly fit their needs, and then communicate that value effectively to them.</p>
            <h2>Key Aspects of Marketing:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Customer Focus:</strong> Centering all activities around understanding and satisfying customer needs.</li>
