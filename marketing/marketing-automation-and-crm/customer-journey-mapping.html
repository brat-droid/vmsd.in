            <p>Customer journey mapping is the process of creating a visual representation of the entire experience a customer has with your company, from initial awareness to post-purchase interactions. It helps businesses understand customer motivations, pain points, and opportunities for improvement at each touchpoint.</p>
            <h2>Key Steps in Customer Journey Mapping:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Define Scope & Objectives:</strong> What specific customer journey are you mapping? What insights do you hope to gain?</li>
                <li><strong>2. Identify Buyer Personas:</strong> Focus on the journey of a specific persona (as discussed in Module 4).</li>
                <li><strong>3. List Touchpoints:</strong> Identify all the interactions a customer has with your brand (online, offline, direct, indirect).</li>
                <li><strong>4. Map the Journey Stages:</strong> Typically includes Awareness, Consideration, Purchase, Retention, and Advocacy.</li>
                <li><strong>5. Document Customer Actions, Thoughts, & Emotions:</strong> For each stage and touchpoint, consider what the customer is doing, thinking, and feeling.</li>
                <li><strong>6. Identify Pain Points & Opportunities:</strong> Where are customers struggling? Where can you improve their experience?</li>
                <li><strong>7. Create the Visual Map:</strong> Use flowcharts, timelines, or other visual aids to represent the journey.</li>
                <li><strong>8. Share & Act:</strong> Distribute the map to relevant teams and use it to inform strategic decisions and improvements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Customer journey mapping provides a holistic view of the customer experience, enabling businesses to design more effective and customer-centric marketing strategies.</p>
