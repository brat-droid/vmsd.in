            <p>Positioning maps (also known as perceptual maps) are visual representations of how consumers perceive different brands or products within a market. They are powerful tools for understanding competitive landscapes and identifying opportunities for differentiation.</p>
            <h2>How Positioning Maps Work:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Typically, a positioning map is a two-dimensional graph with axes representing key attributes or dimensions that are important to consumers (e.g., price vs. quality, innovation vs. tradition).</li>
                <li>Brands are plotted on the map based on consumer perceptions of where they stand on these attributes.</li>
                <li>The closer two brands are on the map, the more similar they are perceived to be by consumers.</li>
                <li>Gaps in the map can indicate untapped market opportunities where a new product or brand could successfully position itself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By creating and analyzing positioning maps, marketers can gain valuable insights into consumer perceptions, identify their brand's current position, and strategize for a desired future position.</p>
