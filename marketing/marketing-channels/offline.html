            <p>Despite the rise of digital marketing, traditional or offline marketing channels continue to play a significant role in reaching target audiences, especially for local businesses or specific demographics.</p>
            <h2>Key Offline Marketing Channels:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Print Media:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Newspapers & Magazines:</strong> Effective for reaching broad or niche audiences, depending on the publication. Can build credibility and trust.</li>
                        <li><strong>Brochures & Flyers:</strong> Tangible marketing materials for direct distribution, often used at events or in retail locations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Broadcast Media:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Television:</strong> High reach and impact, ideal for brand building and emotional appeals. Can be expensive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Radio:</strong> Cost-effective, good for local targeting, and can reach audiences during commutes or daily activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Direct Mail:</strong> Sending physical mail (letters, postcards, catalogs) directly to consumers' homes. Can be highly targeted if mailing lists are well-segmented.</li>
                <li><strong>Outdoor Advertising:</strong> Billboards, bus shelters, transit ads. Great for increasing brand visibility and reaching a mass audience in specific geographic areas.</li>
