            <p>The STP (Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning) model is a core concept in marketing that helps businesses identify the most valuable segments of their market and develop products and marketing messages tailored to them.</p>
            <h2>1. Segmentation:</h2>
            <p>Dividing a broad consumer or business market into sub-groups of consumers (segments) based on some type of shared characteristics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geographic:</strong> Region, city size, climate.</li>
                <li><strong>Demographic:</strong> Age, gender, income, education, family size, occupation.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychographic:</strong> Lifestyle, personality, values, attitudes, interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral:</strong> Usage rate, loyalty, benefits sought, readiness to buy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>2. Targeting:</h2>
            <p>Evaluating each market segment's attractiveness and selecting one or more segments to enter. This involves assessing segment size, growth potential, structural attractiveness, and company objectives/resources.</p>
            <h2>3. Positioning:</h2>
            <p>Arranging for a product to occupy a clear, distinctive, and desirable place relative to competing products in the minds of target consumers. This is where the value proposition comes into play.</p>
            <p>The STP model is a powerful framework for developing effective marketing strategies by focusing resources on the most promising customer segments.</p>
