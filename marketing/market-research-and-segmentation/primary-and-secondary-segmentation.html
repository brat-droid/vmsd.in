        <main class="content">
            <p>Market research is the systematic process of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information about a market, about a product or service to be offered for sale in that market, and about the past, present and potential customers for the product or service; about the characteristics, spending habits, location and needs of the target market, the industry as a whole, and the particular competitors faced.</p>
            <h2>Primary Research:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Original research conducted by you or a third party on your behalf. It's tailored to your specific needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Surveys, interviews, focus groups, observations, field experiments.</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Specific to your needs, proprietary data, deeper insights.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Can be time-consuming and expensive.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Secondary Research:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Data that has already been collected by someone else for another purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Government publications, industry reports, academic journals, trade associations, company websites, news articles.</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Cost-effective, quick to obtain, can provide broad industry insights.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> May not be specific enough, data might be outdated, reliability can vary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Often, a combination of both primary and secondary research yields the most comprehensive understanding of a market.</p>
