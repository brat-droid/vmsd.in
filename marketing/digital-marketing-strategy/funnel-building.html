            <p>A marketing funnel (also known as a sales funnel or conversion funnel) is a visual representation of the journey a potential customer takes from initial awareness of a brand or product to making a purchase and beyond.</p>
            <p>Understanding and optimizing your marketing funnel is crucial for converting prospects into loyal customers.</p>
            <h2>Stages of a Typical Marketing Funnel:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> The top of the funnel, where potential customers first become aware of your brand, product, or service. (e.g., social media ads, blog posts, SEO).</li>
                <li><strong>Interest:</strong> Prospects show interest in your offerings and seek more information. (e.g., website visits, content downloads, email sign-ups).</li>
                <li><strong>Consideration:</strong> Prospects evaluate your solution against competitors and consider making a purchase. (e.g., product demos, case studies, webinars).</li>
                <li><strong>Conversion:</strong> The point where a prospect becomes a customer by making a purchase or taking a desired action. (e.g., online purchase, form submission, sign-up).</li>
                <li><strong>Retention/Loyalty:</strong> Post-purchase activities aimed at keeping customers engaged, encouraging repeat business, and turning them into advocates. (e.g., customer support, loyalty programs, exclusive content).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each stage of the funnel requires different marketing tactics and content to guide the customer effectively towards conversion.</p>
